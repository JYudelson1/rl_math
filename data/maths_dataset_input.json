Hmm, alright, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that an even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in its domain, and an odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). That means, for \\( f \\), swapping the sign of the input doesn't change the output, but for \\( g \\), it flips the sign of the output when the input is negated.\n\nNow, the function in question is \\( f(g(x^3)) \\). I need to determine if this is even, odd, or neither. To check that, I should see if \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\) relates to \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) in a way that fits the definitions.\n\nLet me compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\). First, notice that \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\) because raising a negative to an odd power keeps it negative. So, inside the function \\( g \\), we have \\( g(-x^3) \\).\n\nSince \\( g \\) is an odd function, \\( g(-y) = -g(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). Let me substitute \\( y = x^3 \\), so \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).\n\nNow, substitute this back into the original expression: \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n\nSince \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-z) = f(z) \\) for any \\( z \\). Letting \\( z = g(x^3) \\), it follows that \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nPutting this all together, we have \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), which is \\( f(g(x^3)) \\). This means that the function \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\) satisfies \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), because \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n\nTherefore, by definition, \\( h(x) \\) is an even function.\n\nWait, did I skip any steps? Let me check again.\n\n1. Start with \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n2. Compute \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\).\n3. Simplify the inside: \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\), so \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n4. Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\), so \\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n5. Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n6. That is \\( f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n7. So, \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), which means \\( h \\) is even.\n\nYep, that all checks out. So, whether I cube \\( x \\), apply the odd function \\( g \\), which flips the sign, and then apply the even function \\( f \\), which doesn't care about the sign, results in the overall function being even.\n\nI don't think I made a mistake here. It makes sense because the composition essentially neutralizes the effect of the odd function because of the even function wrapping around it. So, the result is symmetric, hence even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1. Start with \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n2. Compute \\( h(-x) \\):\n   \\[\n   h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3))\n   \\]\n3.

        "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c><\uff5cUser\uff5c>Please solve the following mathematical problem, placing your final answer within \\boxed{}:\nIf $f(x)$ is an even function and $g(x)$ is an odd function, find if $f(g(x^3))$ is even, odd, or neither.\n\nEnter \"odd\", \"even\", or \"neither\".<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither. So, let's start by recalling some basic definitions to get a grip on this.\n\nAn even function satisfies the condition \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in its domain. On the other hand, an odd function meets the condition \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in its domain. Okay, so that's clear. Now, in this problem, we\u2019re dealing with compositions of functions, which can sometimes be tricky, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me establish what we know:\n\n1. \\( f(x) \\) is an even function. That means \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\).\n2. \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, so \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n3. We need to analyze the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) and determine if it's even, odd, or neither.\n\nAlright, let's tackle the composition step by step. Let me define a new function \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\) to make things clearer. The question is whether \\( h(-x) \\) equals \\( h(x) \\) (even), \\( -h(x) \\) (odd), or something else.\n\nSo, to figure out what kind of function \\( h(x) \\) is, let's compute \\( h(-x) \\) and see how it relates to \\( h(x) \\). Let's do that step by step.\n\nStart with \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\). Let's simplify the inner part first. \\( (-x)^3 \\) is equal to \\( -x^3 \\), right? Since when you raise a negative number to an odd power, it remains negative. So, \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\). Therefore, the expression becomes:\n\n\\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n\nNow, I remember that \\( g(x) \\) is odd, so substituting \\( -x^3 \\) into \\( g \\) should give us \\( -g(x^3) \\). Let's write that down:\n\n\\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for \\( h(-x) \\):\n\n\\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n\nHmm, so we have \\( f(-g(x^3)) \\) now. Here, \\( f(x) \\) is even. What happens when we plug in \\( -g(x^3) \\) into an even function?\n\nSince \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). So, if we let \\( y = g(x^3) \\), then:\n\n\\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nBut wait, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is exactly our original function \\( h(x) \\). So, substituting that back:\n\n\\( h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n\nSo, \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), which per the definitions, means that \\( h(x) \\) is even.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any steps or assumptions. Let's go step by step again.\n\n1. \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n2. To find if \\( h(-x) \\) equals \\( h(x) \\) or \\( -h(x) \\), compute \\( h(-x) \\):\n   - \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n3. Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\):\n   - \\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n4. Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n5. Thus, \\( h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n\nYes, everything checks out. So, each step holds. So, the composition \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\nWait another thought\u2014is the composition of an even and an odd function necessarily even or could it vary? Let's think.\n\nSuppose \\( f \\) is even and \\( g \\) is odd. Then, when you compose them, the inside function is odd (\\( g(x^3) \\). But since \\( x^3 \\) is also an odd function (because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\)), composing an odd function \\( g \\) with another odd function \\( x^3 \\) gives us \\( g(x^3) \\) as odd?\n\nWait, hold on: is \\( g(x^3) \\) even, odd, or neither?\n\nIf \\( g \\) is odd, then \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). So, let's compute \\( g((-x)^3) = g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\), because \\( g \\) is odd. So, \\( g(x^3) \\) is an odd function, because \\( g((-x)^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, the inner function \\( g(x^3) \\) is odd.\n\nSo, now, \\( f \\) maps this intermediate odd function. So, \\( h(x) = f \\) (something odd). Since \\( f \\) is even, how does it interact with an odd input?\n\nLet's note that even functions take care of the sign, so \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\). Therefore, no matter if the input to \\( f \\) is odd or not, \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\). So, even when the input is odd, you still get the same value as when you input the positive version.\n\nSo, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), leading to \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), as established before.\n\nBut hold on, let me consider specific examples to verify my conclusion because sometimes these properties can be counter-intuitive.\n\nSuppose \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\), which is odd. Then, computing \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\), which is \\( (x^3)^2 = x^6 \\). Is \\( x^6 \\) even? Yes, because any even power of \\( x \\) is an even function.\n\nAlternatively, take another even function, say \\( f(x) = \\cos(x) \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = \\sin(x) \\), which is odd. Then, \\( h(x) = \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\). Then, \\( h(-x) = \\cos(\\sin((-x)^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(-x^3)) = \\cos(-\\sin(x^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\), because cosine is an even function. Therefore, \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so it is even as well.\n\nBut wait, let me think if I can get an example where the composition is neither even nor odd. Let me see.\n\nSuppose \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x + x^3 \\). Is \\( g(x) \\) odd? Let's check \\( g(-x) = (-x) + (-x)^3 = -x - x^3 = - (x + x^3) = -g(x) \\), so yes, \\( g \\) is odd.\n\nThen \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) = (g(x^3))^2 = (x^3 + (x^3)^3)^2 = (x^3 + x^9)^2 \\). Let me test \\( h(-x) = (-x^3 + (-x^9))^2 = (-x^3 - x^9)^2 = (x^3 + x^9)^2 = h(x) \\). So, still, it's even. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need a different example where maybe \\( f \\) isn't just a power function. Let me take \\( f(x) = |x| \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\), which is odd. Then, \\( h(x) = |x^3| \\). Now, \\( |(-x)^3| = | -x^3 | = |x^3| \\), so \\( h(-x) = |x^3| = h(x) \\), which is still even.\n\nIs there a scenario where the composition would be odd?\n\nWait, for \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) to be odd, we need \\( f(g(-x^3)) = -f(g(x^3)) \\), but since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), so for the antipodal condition to hold, \\( f(g(-x^3)) = -f(g(x^3)) \\) meaning \\( f(-g(x^3)) = -f(g(x^3)) \\), which would only require that \\( f(-y) = -f(y) \\) for \\( y = g(x^3) \\), but since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\). Therefore, unless \\( f(y) \\) is also odd for all \\( y \\), the equality may not hold. But \\( f \\) is given as even, not odd.\n\nTherefore, in general, unless \\( f \\) is both even and odd, which is only possible if it's the zero function, it's impossible for the composition to be odd because \\( f \\) being even forces \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), making \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), hence even.\n\nTherefore, my earlier conclusion seems solid.\n\nSo, summarizing the steps:\n\n- Start with \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n- Compute \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n- Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).\n- Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n- Therefore, \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so \\( h(x) \\) is even.\n\nI think that checks out. I considered some specific examples, and in each case, the composition came out even. I also stepped through the general case again without seeing any contradictions, which supports my conclusion.\n\nSo, to wrap it up, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is an even function.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) ) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1. An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\).\n2. An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\nTo analyze the composition \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\), we compute \\( h(-x) \\):\n\n\\[\nh(-x) = f(g((-x)^3))\n\\]\n\nSince \\((-x)^3 = -x^3\\), we have:\n\n\\[\nh(-x) = f(g(-x^3))\n\\]\n\nBecause \\( g \\) is an odd function:\n\n\\[\ng(-x^3) = -g(x^3)\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\nh(-x) = f(-g(x^3))\n\\]\n\nSince \\( f \\) is an even function:\n\n\\[\nf(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3))\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\nh(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x)\n\\]\n\nThis shows that \\( h(x) \\) is even.

Hmm, okay, let's unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that even functions satisfy \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in their domain. Examples are things like \\( x^2 \\) or cosine functions. On the other hand, odd functions satisfy \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). Examples of odd functions include \\( x^3 \\) or sine functions.\n\nSo, we have \\( f \\) being even, \\( g \\) being odd. The composite function we're looking at is \\( f(g(x^3)) \\). Let me write this out: \\( f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nI need to figure out if this composite function is even, odd, or neither. To do that, I should check the definition of even and odd for composite functions. That is, I should find \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\) and compare it to \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) and see if it equals either \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) or \\( -f(g(x^3)) \\), or neither.\n\nLet's compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\).\n\nFirst, calculate \\( (-x)^3 \\). That's \\( -x^3 \\). So, we have \\( g(-x^3) \\).\n\nBut since \\( g \\) is an odd function, \\( g(-y) = -g(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). Let me substitute \\( y = x^3 \\) here. So, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, \\( f(g(-x^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n\nNow, since \\( f \\) is an even function, \\( f(-z) = f(z) \\) for any \\( z \\). Let me denote \\( z = g(x^3) \\), then \\( f(-z) = f(z) \\).\n\nSo, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). Putting it all together, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). Therefore, the function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) satisfies \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), which is the definition of an even function.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I started by evaluating \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\), which breaks down to \\( f(-g(x^3)) \\) because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\) and \\( g \\) is odd. Then, since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). So the composition is even. Hmm, seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can test it with specific examples to make sure.\n\nLet's take \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) (which is even) and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\) (which is odd). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = (x^3)^2 = x^6 \\). Is \\( x^6 \\) even or odd? Well, substituting \\( -x \\) gives \\( (-x)^6 = x^6 \\), so yes, it's even. So in this case, it's even.\n\nAnother example: Let \\( f(x) = \\cos(x) \\) (which is even) and \\( g(x) = \\sin(x) \\) (which is odd). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\). Let's check if this is even or odd. Compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = \\cos(\\sin((-x)^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(-x^3)) \\). Since \\( \\sin(-x^3) = -\\sin(x^3) \\) (because sine is odd), then \\( \\cos(-\\sin(x^3)) \\). Cosine is an even function, so \\( \\cos(-a) = \\cos(a) \\), so this becomes \\( \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\). Therefore, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), so this composite function is also even. Interesting.\n\nWait, is that always the case, regardless of the specific even and odd functions? Let me test another example. Maybe with \\( f(x) = x^4 \\) (even) and \\( g(x) = x^5 \\) (odd). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = (x^5)^4 = x^{20} \\), which is even because \\( (-x)^{20} = x^{20} \\). Seems okay.\n\nPerhaps an even function that's not just a power, and an odd function that isn't a power. Let's see, \\( f(x) = e^{x^2} \\) (which is even since \\( e^{(-x)^2} = e^{x^2} \\)) and \\( g(x) = \\sin(x) \\) (which is odd). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = e^{(\\sin(x^3))^2} \\). Let's check if this is even: Replace \\( x \\) with \\( -x \\) and see if equality holds.\n\n\\( f(g((-x)^3)) = e^{(\\sin((-x)^3))^2} = e^{(\\sin(-x^3))^2} \\). Since sine is odd, \\( \\sin(-x^3) = -\\sin(x^3) \\). So squaring it, \\( (-\\sin(x^3))^2 = (\\sin(x^3))^2 \\). Therefore, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = e^{(\\sin(x^3))^2} = f(g(x^3)) \\). So again it's even.\n\nHmm, seems that across the board it's even.\n\nAlternatively, let me try if \\( g(x) \\) isn't odd but even, just for testing. Wait, but in this problem, \\( g \\) is odd. So if I wouldn't get the right result? Anyway, in our problem \\( g \\) is odd, so that's consistent.\n\nLet me try another example where \\( f \\) is even, but \\( g \\) is different. Say \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), \\( g(x) = x^3 + x \\), which is odd because \\( g(-x) = -x^3 -x = -(x^3 + x) = -g(x) \\). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = (x^3 + x)^2 = x^6 + 2x^4 + x^2 \\). Test whether this is even: substitute \\( -x \\): \\( (-x)^6 + 2(-x)^4 + (-x)^2 = x^6 + 2x^4 + x^2 \\), which is the same as before. So yes, it's even.\n\nAlternatively, take a non-algebraic even function. Suppose \\( f(x) = |x| \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\), which is odd. Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = |g(x^3)| = |x^9| = |x|^9 \\). Wait, is that even or odd?\n\n\\( |x^9| = |x|^9 \\). Then evaluating at \\( -x \\): \\( |(-x)^9| = | -x^9 | = |x|^9 \\). So they are equal, so \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even again.\n\nWait, so in all these examples, it's even. So is there a reason why? Let's see:\n\n1. Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\n2. Then \\( g(x^3) \\) as is: for any \\( x \\), \\( g(x^3) \\) is... wait, it's not straightforwardly odd or even because \\( x^3 \\) is odd.\n\nWait, but if \\( g \\) is odd, then \\( g(x^3) \\) is still a function, right? Let me check if \\( g(x^3) \\) is even or odd. Let's consider \\( h(x) = g(x^3) \\). Is \\( h(-x) = -h(x) \\) or \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\)?\n\nCompute \\( h(-x) = g((-x)^3) = g(-x^3) \\). But since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). So \\( h(-x) = -g(x^3) = -h(x) \\). Therefore, \\( h(x) = g(x^3) \\) is an odd function.\n\nSo in reality, after the substitution, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) becomes \\( f(h(x)) \\) where \\( h(x) \\) is odd.\n\nNow, since \\( f \\) is even, what happens when we plug an odd function into an even function? Let me recall:\n\nIf \\( h(x) \\) is odd, \\( h(-x) = -h(x) \\). So \\( f(h(-x)) = f(-h(x)) \\). Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-h(x)) = f(h(x)) \\). Therefore, \\( f(h(-x)) = f(h(x)) \\), which means \\( f \\circ h \\) is even, because \\( (f \\circ h)(-x) = (f \\circ h)(x) \\).\n\nTherefore, yes, the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it:\n\nLet me denote \\( y = x^3 \\). Then \\( f(g(y)) \\). Since \\( y = x^3 \\), which has a power of 3. So if I replace \\( x \\) with \\( -x \\), \\( y \\) becomes \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\). So then \\( f(g(-x^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\) because \\( g \\) is odd. And since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). Hence, \\( f(g(x^3)) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\), so the function is even.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the specific even and odd functions chosen, as long as \\( f \\) is even and \\( g \\) is odd, the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) ends up being even.\n\nIs there a situation when this might not hold? Maybe if \\( f \\) or \\( g \\) are not injective or something? Hmm, but the property doesn't depend on injectivity or surjectivity because it's based solely on the functional equations \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) and \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). So since these properties hold for all \\( x \\), regardless of specific behavior, then the composition will always satisfy \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\) making it even.\n\nTherefore, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is an even function.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1. **Properties of Even and Odd Functions**:\n   - An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\).\n   - An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the Composite Function**:\n   - We need to check if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even or odd.\n   - Consider \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\).

I have this math problem here: If f(x) is an even function and g(x) is an odd function, find if f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, odd, or neither. Hmm, I remember that even and odd functions have specific properties, so maybe I can use those to figure it out.\n\nFirst off, let's recall what even and odd functions are. An even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain. So, if I plug in -x, it's the same as plugging in x. Classic examples are functions like f(x) = x\u00b2 or cosine functions.\n\nOn the other hand, an odd function satisfies g(-x) = -g(x). So, flipping the sign of x flips the sign of the output. Examples include g(x) = x\u00b3 or sine functions.\n\nAlright, so in this problem, f is even, g is odd. I need to compute whether the composition f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, odd, or neither. Let me think through the composition step by step.\n\nLet me denote h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)). So, h(x) is the composition of f(g(x\u00b3)). To determine if h(x) is even, odd, or neither, I should check h(-x).\n\nLet me compute h(-x):\n\nh(-x) = f(g((-x)\u00b3)).\n\nFirst, let's process inner function g. Since -x is raised to the 3rd power, (-x)\u00b3 = -x\u00b3. So, the argument becomes -x\u00b3. Then, since g is odd, g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). So, substituting back into h(-x), we have:\n\nh(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n\nNow, since f is even, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)). Let me note that down.\n\nTherefore, h(-x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = h(x). \n\nWait, so h(-x) = h(x). That means h(x) is even because it satisfies the definition of an even function, right? Because plugging in -x doesn't change the value of h(x).\n\nLet me double-check that step:\n\n1. Start with h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n2. To find if it's even or odd, evaluate h(-x).\n3. Compute g(-x\u00b3). Since g is odd, g(-y) = -g(y). So, let y = x\u00b3, then g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3).\n4. Thus, h(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n5. Since f is even, f(-z) = f(z) for any z. Therefore, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n6. Thus, h(-x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = h(x).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, h(-x) = h(x), which is exactly the condition for h(x) being even. Therefore, f(g(x\u00b3)) is an even function.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any steps or misapply the properties. Hmm.\n\nAnother way to think about it: suppose f(x) is even, so f(-y) = f(y). g is odd, so g(-z) = -g(z). So, plugging into h(-x):\n\nh(-x) = f(g((-x)\u00b3)) = f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-g(x\u00b3)) because g is odd. Then, using f is even, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = h(x). So yes, h(-x) = h(x), so h is even.\n\nAlternatively, I can use substitutions:\n\nLet\u2019s consider substituting x with -x in h(x):\n\nh(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(-x^3)) because (-x)^3 is -x^3.\n\nSince g is odd, g(-x^3) = -g(x^3). Plugging that in, h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)).\n\nBut f is even, so f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)).\n\nBut f(g(x^3)) is exactly h(x). So, h(-x) = h(x), so h is even.\n\nTherefore, regardless of specific functions f and g, as long as f is even and g is odd, the composition f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nLet me test with actual functions to verify.\n\nSuppose f(x) = x\u00b2 (which is even) and g(x) = x\u00b3 (which is odd). Then h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = (x\u00b3)^3 = x^9.\n\nWait, is x^9 even or odd? Well, x^9 is an odd function because (-x)^9 = -x^9. So, wait, h(x) = x^9 is odd, which contradicts our earlier conclusion that it's even.\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem right. Did I make an error somewhere?\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me compute h(x) in this case.\n\nf(x) = x\u00b2, g(x) = x\u00b3.\n\nThen h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = f((x\u00b3)^3) = f(x^9) = (x^9)^2 = x^18.\n\nAh, that's even because (-x)^18 = x^18. So h(-x) = (-x)^18 = x^18 = h(x). So, in this case, h(x) is even.\n\nBut earlier, I thought h(x) = x^9, which is odd, but actually, wait, no:\n\nNo, because in the composition f(g(x\u00b3)), with f(x) = x\u00b2, which is even, and g(x\u00b3) is x^9, which is an odd function. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) is (x^9)\u00b2 = x^{18}. So, yes, it's even.\n\nWait, but if I had g(x) = x\u00b3, f(x) = x, then h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = x\u00b3, which is odd. Hmm, but in that case, f is neither even nor odd necessarily? Wait, no.\n\nWait, is f(x) = x considered even or odd? f(-x) = -x = -f(x), so yes, f(x) = x is odd. So in that example, f is odd, right.\n\nBut in our original problem, f is even. So, in my first example, with f being x\u00b2 and g being x\u00b3: f is even, g is odd. So then, h is f(g(x\u00b3)) is x^18, which is even. So that works.\n\nBut wait, if f is the identity function, which is odd, and g is odd, then f(g(x\u00b3)) would be g(x\u00b3), which, if g is odd, would make it odd cubed, which is also odd. So, we can clearly see that the composition's parity depends on the functions involved.\n\nWait, but in our problem, f is even, g is odd.\n\nWait, let me take another example to check.\n\nSuppose f(x) = x^4, which is even. g(x) = x^5, which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) would be (x^5)^3)^4? Wait, no. Wait, no, wait, g(x\u00b3) is x\u00b3^5? Wait, no: Hold on, no. If g(x) = x^5, then g(x\u00b3) = (x\u00b3)^5 = x^{15}.\n\nThen, f(g(x\u00b3)) = f(x^{15}) = (x^{15})^4 = x^{60}. Which is even, because (-x)^60 = x^60. So yes, h(x) = x^{60} is even.\n\nAlternatively, if I took g(x) = x (odd) and f(x) = x\u00b2 (even). Then f(g(x\u00b3)) is (g(x\u00b3))^2 = (x\u00b3)^2 = x^6, which is even. So that works too.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake before when thinking of f(x) = x being odd, but in the problem, f is specifically even. So, in that case, if I have f(x) = x, which is odd, but in our problem, f is even, so we have to use f preserving the symmetry, making the composition even.\n\nAlternatively, what if f is a constant function? Like f(x) = 2, which is even? Wait, f(-x) = 2 = f(x), so yes, constant function is even. Then g(x) is odd, say g(x) = x\u00b3. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) = f(x^9) = 2, which is even because h(-x) = 2 = h(x). So yeah, that still holds.\n\nOkay, so testing multiple cases, and in all of them, f(g(x\u00b3)) is even when f is even and g is odd. So, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, I think the conclusion is that h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) is even under the given conditions.\n\nWait, but just to ensure, what if f is even, g is odd, but, say, f is even like x\u00b2, and g is odd like x, so f(g(x\u00b3)) = (x\u00b3)^2 = x^6, which is even. Alternatively, if g was an odd function but not x\u00b3, say, sin(x). Then f(g(x\u00b3)) = (sin(x\u00b3))\u00b2, which is still even because [sin(-x\u00b3)]\u00b2 = [ - sin(x\u00b3) ]\u00b2 = [sin(x\u00b3)]\u00b2, which is equal to (sin(x\u00b3))\u00b2. So, yeah, squaring it would make it even regardless. That also makes sense because f is even, so whatever comes out of g is squared.\n\nSo, seems solid.\n\nAnother angle: If f is even, then f(-y) = f(y). So, for h(x), h(-x) = f(g(-x\u00b3)).\n\nSince g is odd, g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3).\n\nTherefore:\n\nh(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n\nBecause f is even, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nWhich is h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nTherefore, h(-x) = h(x), which is the definition of even.\n\nYep, so that's consistent.\n\nSo, mathematically, no mistake in the reasoning.\n\nPerhaps my initial confusion came when choosing a function g for h(x) = g(x\u00b3), but when f is not necessarily even, but f is applied to g(x\u00b3), then the behavior is different. But in our problem, f is even, so f(g(x\u00b3)) ends up being even.\n\nHence, I feel confident the answer is even.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\nFirst, recall the definitions:\n- An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n- An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\nTo determine the nature of \\( f(g(x^3)) \\), we evaluate it at \\( -x \\):\n\n1.

Hmm. Let's see. First, I remember that an even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x, and an odd function satisfies f(-x) = -f(x) for all x.\n\nWait, in this case, f(x) is even and g(x) is odd. So I need to see what happens when I compose these functions with x\u00b3 inside. Let me think step by step.\n\nLet me denote h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)). To determine if h(x) is even, odd, or neither, I should check h(-x) and see how it relates to h(x).\n\nSo, h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)). Let me compute (-x)^3 first. Since (-x)^3 = -x\u00b3, that simplifies to -x\u00b3. So h(-x) becomes f(g(-x\u00b3)).\n\nBut since g is an odd function, g(-y) = -g(y) for any y. Let me let y = x\u00b3, then g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). So substituting back, we have h(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n\nNow, f is an even function, so f(-z) = f(z) for any z. Let me set z = g(x\u00b3), so f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)). Therefore, h(-x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = h(x).\n\nSince h(-x) = h(x), that means h(x) is an even function. So f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nWait, let me go over that again to make sure I didn't skip a step. So f is even, so applying f to something negative is the same as applying f to the positive version. Therefore, h(-x) becomes f of g(-x\u00b3) which is f(g(-x\u00b3)). Since g is odd, g(-x\u00b3) is -g(x\u00b3). So h(-x) becomes f(-g(x\u00b3)). Since f is even, that's the same as f(g(x\u00b3)) which is h(x). So yes, h(-x) = h(x). Therefore, h(x) is even.\n\nHmm, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. Let me double-check with an example maybe? Maybe pick specific f and g functions and test.\n\nSuppose f(x) = x\u00b2, which is even. Let g(x) = x\u00b3 - x, which is an odd function since g(-x) = (-x)^3 - (-x) = -x\u00b3 + x = -(x\u00b3 - x) = -g(x). So f(g(x\u00b3)) would be (g(x\u00b3))\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute g(x\u00b3): g(x\u00b3) = (x\u00b3)^3 - x\u00b3 = x^9 - x\u00b3. Then h(x) = (x^9 - x\u00b3)^2. Let's see what h(-x) is: h(-x) = ((-x)^9 - (-x)^3)^2 = (-x^9 + x^3)^2 = (x^3 - x^9)^2, which is the same as (x^9 - x^3)^2. So h(-x) = h(x). Yep, so that's even.\n\nAnother example: Let\u2019s pick f(x) = cos(x), which is even, and g(x) = sin(x), which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) is cos(sin(x\u00b3)). Now, let's check if this is even. \n\nh(-x) = cos(sin((-x)^3)) = cos(sin(-x\u00b3)) = cos(-sin(x\u00b3)) because sin is odd. But cos is even, so cos(-sin(x\u00b3)) = cos(sin(x\u00b3)) = h(x). So again, h(-x) = h(x). Therefore, even.\n\nWait, what if f is even but g is not necessarily linear? Let's try another one. Let f(x) = e^x + e^{-x}, which is also even. Because f(-x) = e^{-x} + e^{x} = f(x). Let\u2019s let g(x) = x^3, which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) = e^{g(x\u00b3)} + e^{-g(x\u00b3)} = e^{x^9} + e^{-x^9}. Now test h(-x). h(-x) = e^{(-x)^9} + e^{-(-x)^9} = e^{-x^9} + e^{x^9}, which is the same as h(x). So still even.\n\nWait, let me try with an f that's even, and g that's odd but not linear. Let\u2019s take f(x) = |x|, since it's even. Let g(x) be any odd function, say, g(x) = x^5 - x, which is odd.\n\nThen f(g(x\u00b3)) is |g(x\u00b3)| = |x^15 - x\u00b3|. Now, let's find h(-x) = |g((-x)^3)| = |g(-x\u00b3)| = | -g(x\u00b3) | = | - (x^15 - x\u00b3) | = |x^15 - x\u00b3| because absolute value of negative is positive. So again, h(-x) = h(x). Even.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Let me think if there's a case where it's not even.\n\nWait, suppose f is even, say f(x) = x^4 which is even, and g(x) = x^3 - x^5, which is still odd. Hmm, then g(x\u00b3) is (x\u00b3)^3 - (x\u00b3)^5 = x^9 - x^{15}, so h(x) = (x^9 - x^{15})^4. Then h(-x) = ((-x)^9 - (-x)^{15})^4. But since -x^9 = -x^9 and -x^{15} = -x^{15}. So (-x^9 - (-x^{15})) = -x^9 + x^{15}. Then h(-x) is (-x^9 + x^{15})^4.\n\nBut (-x^9 + x^{15}) is equal to -(x^9 - x^{15}), and raising it to the 4th power: (-1)^4*(x^9 - x^{15})^4 = (x^9 - x^{15})^4, same as h(x). So h(-x)=h(x). Thus even.\n\nAnother scenario: suppose f is even, g is odd, so f(g(x\u00b3)). So plugging in -x into x\u00b3 gives -x\u00b3, which, because g is odd, gives -g(x\u00b3). And since f is even, f(-g(x\u00b3))=f(g(x\u00b3))=h(x). So algebraically, yes, it's even. \n\nWait, is there any case where this wouldn't hold? Maybe if the functions are more complicated? Suppose f is even, g is odd, and f(g(x\u00b3)) is a constant function, which is also even or odd? Wait, let's say f is the constant function. Suppose f(x)=1, which is even. Let g(x)=x, which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3))=1, which is even. So in that case, it's even. Alternatively, f(x)=0 is even, g(x)=0, which is even\u2014wait, is zero function considered both even and odd? Wait, actually, the zero function is both even and odd since f(-x)=f(x) and f(-x)=-f(x). So in that trivial case, it's both.\n\nBut regardless, if h(x) is both even and odd, it's actually the zero function. But in the above problem, f is even, g is odd, so f(g(x\u00b3)) would have to be... Wait, except for the zero function, other cases?\n\nWait, if g(x\u00b3) is such that g(x\u00b3) is a constant function? Hmm, like if g(x) is a constant. Let me say g(x)=k, which is a constant. Then since g is a constant, which is also even because g(-x)=k=-k? No, wait, g(x)=k implies that it's even if k= -k, which implies k=0. So if g is a constant function, it's a constant zero function, because otherwise, if it's a non-zero constant, g(-x)=g(x) as it's a constant, but for oddity, g(-x)=-g(x), which would require k = -k, meaning k must be zero.\n\nSo in that case, if g was a constant non-zero, it can't be odd. So g must be zero function. Then f(g(x\u00b3))=f(0). If f is even, f(0) is a constant. So the result is a constant, which as I said, is both even and odd.\n\nBut in that case, is that different from just being even? Well, if it is a constant function, it's both. So, in terms of whether it's considered even or just even? Since only even and odd functions are usually defined up to sign, but as per problem statement, we can say it's even because it satisfies the condition without violating being odd. Wait, but if a function is both even and odd, it's the zero function. So if f(x)=0, then h(x)=0 is both, but in this case, if g(x)=0, then h(x)=f(0), which is a constant. So if f(0) is non-zero, h(x)=c, which is both even and odd only if c=0.\n\nBut in any case, regardless of that specific case, since in the earlier steps we showed that h(-x)=h(x), which is sufficient for being even. It might also be odd if h(x)=0, but in that case, only the zero function is both. Otherwise, h(x) would just be even.\n\nSo, when dealing with h(x)=f(g(x\u00b3)), since g is odd, the composition flips the sign, but f, being even, negates it back, leading h(x) to be even. Alternatively, all the steps algebraically lead to h(-x)=h(x). So I think it's safe to conclude that f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nI think my thought process is solid here. So, the answer must be even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nTo determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither, we start by noting that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function. \n\nA function \\( h(x) \\) is even if \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\) for all \\( x \\), and it is odd if \\( h(-x) = -h(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\nLet \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).

It tells me that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function. Hmm, okay, let me recall some properties of even and odd functions.\n\nAn even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\), right? So, if I plug in \\(-x\\), it's the same as plugging in \\( x \\). Classic examples are like \\( x^2 \\) or cosine functions. On the other hand, an odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). These functions are symmetric about the origin. Examples include \\( x^3 \\) or sine functions.\n\nSo, the problem is about composing functions here: \\( f(g(x^3)) \\). Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that \\( x^3 \\) is an odd function because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\). So, \\( g(x^3) \\) would be \\( g(\\text{something odd}) \\). But wait, \\( g \\) is an odd function, so does that mean \\( g(x^3) \\) is odd?\n\nLet me test it: if I plug in \\(-x\\) into \\( g(x^3) \\), it becomes \\( g((-x)^3) = g(-x^3) \\). Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, \\( g(x^3) \\) is indeed an odd function because \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).\n\nSo, now we have \\( g(x^3) \\) as an odd function. The next step is applying \\( f \\) to it. \\( f \\) is even, so \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). Let me set \\( y = g(x^3) \\). Then, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\) because \\( f \\) is even.\n\nNow, to check if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even or odd, I need to evaluate it at \\( -x \\) and see what happens. Let's compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\).\n\nFirst, \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\), so inside the function, we have \\( g(-x^3) \\). But as established earlier, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n\nSince \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). So, replacing \\( x \\) with \\( -x \\) in \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) doesn't change the value; that is, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). \n\nBy the definition of even functions, if \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), then \\( h(x) \\) is even. So here, \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\), and plugging in \\( -x \\) doesn't change the value. That suggests that \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is indeed an even function.\n\nWait, let me make sure there are no mistakes here. What if the composition is more complex? Hmm, let's try a concrete example.\n\nSuppose \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\), which is odd. Then, \\( f(g(x^3)) = (x^3)^2 = x^6 \\). Now, is \\( x^6 \\) even? Yes, because \\( (-x)^6 = x^6 \\). That works.\n\nLet me try another example. Let \\( f(x) = \\cos(x) \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = \\sin(x) \\), which is odd. Then, \\( g(x^3) = \\sin(x^3) \\). Applying \\( f \\), we get \\( \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\). Hmmm, is this function even or odd?\n\nLet's test \\( \\cos(\\sin((-x)^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(-x^3)) \\). Since sine is odd, \\( \\sin(-x^3) = -\\sin(x^3) \\), so \\( \\cos(-\\sin(x^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\) because cosine is even. So, indeed, the composition remains the same when replacing \\( x \\) with \\( -x \\), which means it's even. That seems to back up my earlier conclusion.\n\nIs there a case where it might not be even? Suppose \\( f \\) is a constant function, which is trivially even. Then \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is just a constant, which is even. If \\( f \\) is something else, like \\( f(x) = |x| \\), which is also even, then composing with any odd function inside would still give an even function because \\( |g(x^3)| \\) is the same as \\( |g(-x^3)| \\) since both \\( x^3 \\) and \\( -x^3 \\) are mapped to their absolute values by \\( f \\).\n\nSo, it seems consistent. Each example I test is confirming that the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even when \\( f \\) is even and \\( g \\) is odd. I don't see a scenario where it could be odd. Since both functions have specific symmetries, the result inherits the symmetry from \\( f \\).\n\nWait, but why does it not become odd? Suppose \\( f \\) was odd instead, but in our case, it's even. So, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is made by an even function composed with an odd function inside another odd function. That seems like it would preserve some symmetry but not necessarily switch it.\n\nWait, perhaps another angle: if \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\), and then \\( f(g(-x)) = f(-g(x)) \\). But since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x)) = f(g(x)) \\). So, \\( f(g(-x)) = f(g(x)) \\), which means \\( f(g(x)) \\) is even.\n\nTherefore, in our case, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even because \\( f(g(-x^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nYes, that seems to solidify the conclusion. So, applying \\( f \\) after an odd function preserves the evenness because of how even functions treat negatives inside.\n\nSo, to recap, since \\( g(x^3) \\) is odd, when you apply an even function \\( f \\) to it, the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) becomes even. Therefore, the answer should be that \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is an even function.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1. An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n2. An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n3. The function \\( x^3 \\) is an odd function because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\).\n\nFirst, we evaluate \\( g(x^3) \\):\n- Since \\( g \\) is an odd function, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, \\( g(x^3) \\) is an odd function.\n\nNext, we apply the even function \\( f \\) to \\( g(x^3) \\):\n- Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). Let \\( y = g(x^3) \\). Then, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nTo check if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, we evaluate it at \\( -x \\):\n- \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n- Since \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\), we have \\( f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n- Because \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nThus, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even because it satisfies the condition \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nThe function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>",

So, we have two functions here: f(x) is even, and g(x) is odd. The question is asking about the nature of another function, f(g(x\u00b3)). Is it even, odd, or neither?\n\nOkay, let me recall my function properties. Even functions satisfy the condition f(-x) = f(x), right? So, for example, f(x) = x\u00b2 is even because (-x)\u00b2 = x\u00b2. On the other hand, odd functions satisfy g(-x) = -g(x), like g(x) = x\u00b3 because (-x)\u00b3 = -x\u00b3.\n\nSo, we're dealing with f(g(x\u00b3)). Let me break this down step by step. First, I can think of the operations as a composition of functions. So, starting from the innermost function, we have x\u00b3, then we apply g to that, and finally f to the result.\n\nGiven that, let's try to test whether f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, odd, or neither. The standard method is to compute f(g((-x)\u00b3)) and see how it relates to f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n1. Compute (-x)\u00b3: that's -x\u00b3. Okay, that negative sign is important.\n2. Then apply g to that result: g(-x\u00b3). But since g is an odd function, g(-a) = -g(a) for any a. So, g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3).\n3. Now, we plug that into f: f(-g(x\u00b3)). So, we have f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n\nBut wait, f is an even function. Even functions satisfy f(-y) = f(y) for any y. So, if we let y = g(x\u00b3), then f(-y) = f(y). Therefore, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nPutting it all together: f(g((-x)\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)). \n\nThis means that when we substitute -x into the function f(g(x\u00b3)), we just get the same value as f(g(x\u00b3)). Which by definition of even functions is exactly what even means.\n\nSo, it seems that f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nBut hold on, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It often helps to test with specific examples for f and g that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nLet's choose f(x) as an even function. The simplest example is f(x) = x\u00b2.\n\nLet's pick g(x) as an odd function. Again, the simplest example is g(x) = x\u00b3.\n\nNow, let's compute f(g(x\u00b3)). Let's see:\n\n- First, compute x\u00b3. Then, apply g to that: g(x\u00b3) = (x\u00b3)\u00b3 = x\u2079.\n- Then, apply f to x\u2079: f(x\u2079) = (x\u2079)\u00b2 = x\u00b9\u2078.\n\nSo, f(g(x\u00b3)) = x\u00b9\u2078.\n\nNow, is x\u00b9\u2078 an even function? Well, yes, because if we replace x with -x, we have (-x)\u00b9\u2078 = x\u00b9\u2078, which is the same as the original function.\n\nSo, in this specific example, f(g(x\u00b3)) is indeed an even function.\n\nLet me try another example to make sure my reasoning isn't flawed.\n\nLet me choose a different even function, say f(x) = cos(x), which is even since cos(-x) = cos(x).\n\nAnd another odd function, say g(x) = x.\n\nSo, f(g(x\u00b3)) becomes f(x\u00b3) = cos(x\u00b3).\n\nIs cos(x\u00b3) even? Yes, because cos(-x\u00b3)=cos(x\u00b3). So, it maintains the evenness.\n\nAnother example: f(x) = |x|, which is even, and g(x) = sin(x), which is odd.\n\nThen, f(g(x\u00b3)) = |g(x\u00b3)| = |sin(x\u00b3)|. Is this even? Let's see: |sin(-x\u00b3)| = | - sin(x\u00b3) | = |sin(x\u00b3)|, so yes, it is even.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Maybe I should try a non-monotonic example.\n\nLet\u2019s take f(x) = x\u00b2 + 1, which is still even, and g(x) = x\u00b3 - x, which is odd because g(-x) = (-x)\u00b3 - (-x) = -x\u00b3 + x = - (x\u00b3 - x) = -g(x).\n\nThen, f(g(x\u00b3)) would be [g(x\u00b3)]\u00b2 + 1 = [ (x\u00b3)\u00b3 - (x\u00b3) ]\u00b2 + 1 = (x\u2079 - x\u00b3)\u00b2 + 1.\n\nExpanding this, we get (x\u00b9\u2078 - 2x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u2076) + 1. Is this even? Yes, since all the exponents are even numbers. So replacing x with -x would yield the same result: [ (-x)\u2079 - (-x)\u00b3 ]\u00b2 + 1 = (-x\u2079 + x\u00b3)\u00b2 + 1 = (x\u2079 - x\u00b3)\u00b2 + 1, which is the same as the original.\n\nSo, again, it's even. Hmm, interesting. Maybe this is a consistent result.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me try a function where perhaps f(g(x\u00b3)) could have different behavior.\n\nSuppose f(x) is even, but not as straightforward, like f(x) = e^(-x\u00b2), which is even since it's symmetric around the y-axis. And then g(x) is odd, say g(x) = x. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) = e^(-x\u2076). Which is still even because exponentials of even powers remain even.\n\nHold on, let me see if I can manage a contrived example where f(g(x\u00b3)) isn't even. Maybe f(x) is even, but somehow g doesn't preserve the signature. But given that g is odd, g(-x) = -g(x), which would inherently create symmetry that when squared or composed within f, which is even, might nullify any asymmetry.\n\nThinking in terms of composition, if you have an even function applied on an odd function, then inside you have an odd function, then applied to an even function, overall what is the result? Wait, perhaps we can think about it as f(g(x)).\n\nBut in our case, it's f(g(x\u00b3)). So, perhaps let\u2019s dissect that:\n\nFirst, x\u00b3 is an odd function, because if you flip x to -x, it becomes -x\u00b3. Then, applying g, which is itself an odd function, so g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). Then, applying f, which is even, so f(-g(x\u00b3))=f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nSo, in other words, f(g(-x\u00b3))=f(g(x\u00b3)) which is exactly the condition for f(g(x\u00b3)) being even.\n\nTherefore, it does hold.\n\nThus, yes, f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nI think that seems consistent across multiple examples. So, I can conclude that f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1. **Understanding the properties**:\n   - An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\).\n   - An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\n2. **Testing the composition**:\n   - Compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\).\n   - Simplify \\( (-x)^3 \\) to \\( -x^3 \\).\n   - Apply \\( g \\) to \\( -x^3 \\).

And g(x) is odd, so g(-y) = -g(y). Now, I need to determine the nature of the composite function f(g(x^3)). \n\nFirst, maybe I should express f(g(x^3)) in terms of x and then evaluate it at -x to see how it behaves. Let me denote h(x) = f(g(x^3)), so h(-x) will be f(g((-x)^3)). Hmm, since (-x)^3 is equal to -x^3, this simplifies to h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)). \n\nBut wait, g is an odd function, so g(-y) = -g(y). Let me substitute y with x^3 in this equation, so g(-x^3) = -g(x^3). Therefore, h(-x) becomes f(-g(x^3)). \n\nNow, f is an even function, so f(-z) = f(z) for any z. Let me let z = g(x^3), so f(-g(x^3)) becomes f(g(x^3)). Therefore, h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) which is exactly h(x). \n\nSo that means h(-x) = h(x), which is the definition of an even function. So, f(g(x^3)) is an even function. Let me just go through that step by step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n1. Start with h(x) = f(g(x^3)).\n2. Compute h(-x): f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(-x^3)).\n3. Since g is odd, g(-x^3) = -g(x^3).\n4. So, h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)).\n5. Since f is even, f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)).\n6. And that is h(x).\n7. Hence, h(-x) = h(x), so h(x) is even.\n\nYeah, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in that reasoning. So, f(g(x^3)) should be even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine whether the function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1.

Okay, so:\n\nf(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-g(x\u00b3))\n\nNow, f is an even function, so f(-y) = f(y) for any y. Therefore, replacing y with g(x\u00b3):\n\nf(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3))\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nf(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3))\n\nWhich means f(g(x\u00b3)) satisfies f(-x) = f(x), right? Because replacing x with -x gives the same value.\n\nWait a second, does that make f(g(x\u00b3)) an even function?\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn\u2019t skip a step.\n\nWe had f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-g(x\u00b3)). Since f is even, -g(x\u00b3) inside f is the same as g(x\u00b3), so f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nTherefore, f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)), meaning f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nWait, is there another perspective? Maybe thinking about the composition of functions and their symmetries.\n\nLet me consider the composition f(g(x\u00b3)). The inside function is x\u00b3, which is odd because (-x)\u00b3 = -x\u00b3. So, the inside function is odd.\n\nThen, the outside function is f, which is even. So, f of an odd function? But how does that affect the composition?\n\nIf I recall, composing an even function around an odd function, what does that do? Hmm. Let me think about transformations.\n\nIf you have an even function, say f, and you plug another function h(x) into it. Then, f(h(-x)) = f(-h(x)) because h is odd. But since f is even, f(-h(x)) = f(h(x)). So, f(h(-x)) = f(h(x)).\n\nWhich means f(h(x)) is even.\n\nIn our problem, h(x) is x\u00b3, which is odd. Therefore, f(g(x\u00b3)) as a composition of an even function f around an odd function g(x\u00b3) is even.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, is x\u00b3 an odd function? Yes, because (-x)^3 = -x\u00b3.\n\nThen, g being odd, so plugging that in, I have g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). Then, plugging that into f, which is even, so f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nThat gives us f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)), so f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nLet me try testing it with specific functions to see if this makes sense.\n\nSuppose g(x) = x, which is definitely odd, and f(x) = x\u00b2, which is even. So, f(g(x\u00b3)) = (x\u00b3)\u00b2 = x^6. Is x^6 even? Yes, because (-x)^6 = x^6.\n\nAnother example: Let g(x) = x\u00b3 (which is odd), and f(x) = x^4 (even). Then, f(g(x)) = (x\u00b3)^4 = x^{12}, which is even.\n\nWait, maybe an example where g(x) is some other odd function, like g(x) = sin(x). Let f(x) = x\u00b2 (even). Then, f(g(x^3)) = (sin(x\u00b3))^2. Is that even?\n\nYes, because (sin((-x)^3))^2 = (sin(-x\u00b3))^2 = (-sin(x\u00b3))^2 = (sin(x\u00b3))^2. So, it's even.\n\nAnother test case: let g(x) = -x, which is odd, because g(-x) = -(-x) = x = -g(x). Wait, really? No, actually, g(-x) = -(-x) = x = -g(x) if g(x) = -x. Wait, plugging in x, g(x) = -x, so g(-x) = -(-x) = x, which is -g(x). So, it is odd. So, putting into f(x) = x^3, which is odd, but f needs to be even. So, f(g(x^3)) = (g(x^3))^3 = ( -x^9 )^3 = -x^{27}, which is odd. Wait, hold on, but f is supposed to be even. Wait, let me redo that.\n\nHold on, if f is even, so f(x) = |x| for example. Then, f(g(x\u00b3)) = |g(x\u00b3)|. Since g is odd, g(x\u00b3) is odd, so |g(x\u00b3)| is even, right? Because absolute value makes all negatives positive.\n\nWait, actually, if g(x) is odd, then g(x^3) is odd because x\u00b3 is odd so composing it with g (odd) gives odd, as substitution. So |g(x\u00b3)| is even because the absolute value wraps it, so flipping the sign doesn't matter. Therefore, even.\n\nBut maybe if f is x^2, which is even, f(g(x\u00b3)) = [g(x\u00b3)]\u00b2, which is [(-x\u00b3)]\u00b2 = x^6, which is even.\n\nWait, but if f is an even function and g is odd, f(g(x\u00b3)) is going to be f of something that is odd, but f is even, so f(-y) = f(y). Therefore, f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nWait, yeah, as in the first step. So, f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nThese test cases are showing it's even, so my conclusion seems right.\n\nWait, let me see one more test case where f and g might be more complicated. Suppose f(x) = |x| + x\u00b2, which is even, and g(x) = x, which is odd. Then, f(g(x\u00b3)) = |x\u00b3| + (x\u00b3)\u00b2 = |x\u00b3| + x^6, which is even because absolute value is even and x^6 is even. So, sum is even.\n\nAnother example: f(x) = e^{x} + e^{-x}, which is even, since substituting -x gives e^{-x} + e^{x} which is the same. If g(x) is any odd function, say, g(x) = x. Then, f(g(x\u00b3)) = e^{x\u00b3} + e^{-x\u00b3}, which is even.\n\nWait, is that even? Because if I put -x, I get e^{-x\u00b3} + e^{x\u00b3}, which is the same as before. So yes, even yes.\n\nWait, another odd function for g: g(x) = x^3, so that's an odd function, plug into an even f(x). If f(x) = x^4, then f(g(x\u00b3)) is (x^3)^4 = x^{12}, which is even. If f(x) is |x|, then f(g(x\u00b3)) = |x^3| = |x| x^2, which is even.\n\nSo, all my test cases are giving me that f(g(x\u00b3)) is even. Therefore, I think it's safe to conclude it's even.\n\nWait, what would happen if g were even? Then, g(-x) = g(x), so f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)), and if f is even as well, then f(g(x\u00b3)) would still be even. But in this case, g is odd, so that composition flips to f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)), so the same function.\n\nSo, yeah, seems that as long as f is even and g is odd, then f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to think in terms of composition properties. So, f(g(x\u00b3)) is a composition where the innermost function is x\u00b3 which is odd, composing with g, which is odd, so the result is still odd if you consider g(x\u00b3). Then, f is even, so function f applied to an odd function.\n\nBut when you apply an even function on an odd function, do you get even or odd? So, if h(x) is odd, then f(h(x)) where f is even. Then, f(h(-x)) = f(-h(x)) = f(h(x)). So, f(h(-x)) = f(h(x)), which means f(h(x)) is even.\n\nHence f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nSo, that seems to fit.\n\nAlternatively, because x\u00b3 is odd, the composition inside is g(x\u00b3), which is odd, then f is even, so the outer function is even, so when you apply it to an odd function, you get an even function.\n\nHence, all of these lines of thought lead me to the conclusion that it's even. Therefore, the answer should be even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nTo determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither, we start by recalling the properties of even and odd functions.

Since \\( g(x^3) \\) is an odd function composed with \\( x^3 \\) (which is also odd), \\( g(x^3) \\) is odd.\n2. We then consider \\( f(g(x^3)) \\). Since \\( g(x^3) \\) is odd, we have \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).\n3. Applying \\( f \\) to this result, we get \\( f(g(-x^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n4. Because \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nThus, \\( f(g(-x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), which shows that \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{even}\\).<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>",

I need to determine whether the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\nFirst, let me recall some definitions. An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in its domain. On the other hand, an odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). Now, I need to analyze the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nLet me break it down step by step. The composition involves three functions: first, \\( x^3 \\), then \\( g \\), and finally \\( f \\). So, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is a composition of these three functions.\n\nSince \\( x^3 \\) is a function, let's think about whether it's even or odd. Remember, \\( (x)^3 \\) is an odd function because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\). So, the innermost function \\( x^3 \\) is odd.\n\nNext, \\( g(x) \\) is given as an odd function, so if I apply \\( g \\) to \\( x^3 \\), which is odd, how does that affect the result? Let me compute \\( g(x^3) \\). If \\( g \\) is odd, then \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). But since we're dealing with \\( g \\) applied to \\( x^3 \\), maybe it's helpful to consider substituting \\( -x \\) into \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) and see what happens.\n\nSo, let's define \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\). To check if \\( h(x) \\) is even or odd, I'll compute \\( h(-x) \\) and compare it to \\( h(x) \\) and \\( -h(x) \\).\n\nComputing \\( h(-x) \\):\n\n\\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\)  \nSimplify \\( (-x)^3 \\).  \n\\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\), so  \n\\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n\nNow, since \\( g \\) is an odd function, \\( g(-y) = -g(y) \\) for any y. Let me set \\( y = x^3 \\), so:\n\n\\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).  \nTherefore,  \n\\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).  \nBut \\( f \\) is an even function. Applying an even function to \\( -g(x^3) \\) gives:  \n\\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), because \\( f(-a) = f(a) \\) when \\( f \\) is even.\n\nSo, \\( h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( h(x) \\) satisfies the condition for being an even function: \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\). Hence, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\nWait, let me go through that again to make sure I haven't missed anything. Starting with \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\). \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\) because \\( g \\) is odd. Then, passing this through \\( f \\), which is even, so \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). That brings us back to \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so yes, it's definitely even.\n\nIs there a possibility that this could be neither? Hmm, not unless maybe the composition somehow disrupts the evenness or oddness in a non-uniform way, but in this case, each step follows from the properties of even and odd functions.\n\nWait, let me think about function composition in general. So, if I have f(g(x)), where f is even and g is odd, does it always result in an even function?\n\nLet me test with concrete functions. Let me choose f(x) = x\u00b2 (which is even) and g(x) = x\u00b3 (which is odd). Then, f(g(x)) = (x\u00b3)\u00b2 = x\u2076, which is even, because substituting -x gives (-x)^6 = x^6, same as f(g(x)). So that's consistent.\n\nAnother example: Let f(x) = cos(x) which is even, and g(x) = sin(x) which is odd. Then f(g(x)) = cos(sin(x)). Now, is this even? Let's test for x:\n\nf(g(-x)) = cos(sin(-x)) = cos(-sin(x)) = cos(sin(x)) because cosine is even. Therefore, f(g(-x)) = f(g(x)), so it is even. Therefore, this composition is also even.\n\nConversely, if I have f(x) even and g(x) odd, another thought: What if f is a reflection or something else? Wait, f and g are arbitrary functions with those parity properties. So as long as f is even, applying f to an odd function in this way gives an even result.\n\nWait a sec, but in the composition, do we ensure anything about the function's expression? For instance, is it always that way regardless of what f and g are, as long as f is even and g is odd?\n\nLet me see. Suppose f is another even function, say f(x) = x^4, and g(x) = x^3. Then, f(g(x)) = (x^3)^4 = x^{12}, which is even. So it still holds. What if I choose f(x) = |x|, which is even, and g(x) = x^3, which is odd? Then f(g(x)) is |x^3|, which is even as | -x^3 | = |x^3|. So yes.\n\nWhat if g(x) is a more complicated odd function? For example, \\( g(x) = x - x^3 \\). Wait, is that odd? Let's check: g(-x) = (-x) - (-x)^3 = -x - (-x^3) = -x + x^3. Which is not equal to -g(x), because -g(x) = -x + x^3. So in that case, g(x) would satisfy g(-x) = -g(x), meaning it is still odd.\n\nThen, \\( f(g(x)) = (x - x^3)^2 \\), which is even, because squared removes any negative signs.\n\nAlternatively, let me try another approach without plugging in specific functions. Let's compose f and g symbolically.\n\nSince \\( f(x) \\) is even, we know \\( f(-a) = f(a) \\) for any \\( a \\). Let \\( a = g(x^3) \\), then \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). Now, \\( g \\) is odd, so \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). So if I consider \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\), but as \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\). So \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so \\( h(x) \\) is even.\n\nThus, in every case, regardless of what f and g are (as long as f is even and g is odd), the composition \\( f \\circ g \\circ (-x^3) \\) will result in an even function.\n\nWait a moment, what if I made a mistake in how the functions compose? Hmm, the composition is \\( f(g(x^3)) \\), so x is cubed first, then g is applied, then f is applied. So \\( x^3 \\) is in the inner argument of g, which is odd, and then f is an even function on that result.\n\nHmm, another thing, let's suppose \\( f \\) is a non-trivial even function and \\( g \\) is a non-trivial odd function. Is their composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) necessarily even? Since the composition only involves substituting \\( -x \\) into \\( g(x^3) \\), which, since \\( g \\) is odd, negates the whole expression, but then \\( f \\) is even, so it doesn't negate anything.\n\nSo seems like no matter what, substituting \\( -x \\) in the outermost function doesn't change the result because \\( f \\) is even, negating the entire inner function, but after \\( g \\) is already odd.\n\nTherefore, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\nBut wait, just to test an example where perhaps the composition would not be even? Is that possible?\n\nWait, if we mess with the order, for example, suppose \\( f(g x) \\) then cube it, but in our case, it's \\( f(g(x^3)) \\), so the structure is fixed. Maybe if the functions were inside differently, but here it's as above.\n\nAlternatively, taking \\( x \\rightarrow -x \\):\n\nf(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(-x^3)) because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\).  \nThen, since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).  \nThus, \\( f(-g(x^3)) \\).  \nBut \\( f \\) is even, so \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nSo again, we get \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so h is even.\n\nTherefore, in the given composition order, f(g(x^3)), where f is even, g is odd, \\( x^3 \\) is odd.\n\nTherefore, it's even.\n\nWait, so it can't be neither because it is equal to h(-x) = h(x). So that suggests it is even.\n\nBut maybe we can think if there is a case when it could be neither.\n\nIs there an instance where substituting the negative variable leads to something different that's not h(x) but not equal to h(-x)?\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nDefine a specific even f and odd g and see.\n\nLet f(x) = x^4 (even), g(x) = x^5 (odd), so f(g(x^3)) = (x^3)^5)^4? Wait, hold on. Wait, f(g(x)) is f(x^5) when given x^3.\n\nWait, wait, doh, let's fix that.\n\nWait, \\( f(g(x^3)) = (g(x^3))^4 \\) because f(x) is x^4. So if \\( g(x) = x^5 \\), then \\( g(x^3) = (x^3)^5 = x^{15} \\), so \\( f(g(x^3)) = (x^{15})^4 = x^{60} \\). Then, since that's even because x^{60} is even, same as x^{60} is (-x)^{60} = x^{60}.\n\nWait, so that's an example of an even function.\n\nAnother example, let\u2019s take f(x) = cos(x), which is even, and g(x) = sin(x), which is odd. Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\). Wait, sin is odd, so sin(x^3) is odd because it's composed with x^3 which is odd (and sin is odd: sin(-y) = -sin(y)). So sin(x^3) is odd.\n\nThen, cos is even, so cos(-y) = cos(y). So cos(sin(x^3)) = cos(-sin(x)) = cos(sin(x)). So this is equality, hence, h(-x) = h(x), so it is even.\n\nWait, but actually \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is a function whose evenness we've established, so in all cases, function h(x) satisfies h(-x) = h(x). So, h is even.\n\nTherefore, despite the compositions, h is even.\n\nSo, in all steps, the result becomes even.\n\nConclusion: \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine whether the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\nFirst, recall the definitions:\n- An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\).\n- An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\nWe need to analyze the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\).

I need to figure out whether f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, odd, or neither. Hmm, let's start by recalling what it means for a function to be even or odd.\n\nAn even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain. On the other hand, an odd function satisfies g(-x) = -g(x) for all x in its domain. So, f(x) is even, meaning if I plug in -x, it's the same as plugging in x. And g(x) is odd, meaning plugging in -x flips the sign of the function.\n\nI need to analyze the function h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)). Let's see, I should check if h(-x) equals h(x) or -h(x) or neither. That will tell me if h(x) is even, odd, or neither.\n\nStarting with h(-x), which is f(g((-x)\u00b3)). Let me compute the inside first: (-x)\u00b3. Since any odd power preserves the sign, (-x)\u00b3 = -x\u00b3. So, h(-x) becomes f(g(-x\u00b3)).\n\nNow, since g is an odd function, g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). So, substituting that back, h(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)). \n\nNow, looking at f(-g(x\u00b3)). Since f is even, f(-t) = f(t) for any t. Let's set t = g(x\u00b3). So, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)). Therefore, h(-x) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nBut wait, f(g(x\u00b3)) is exactly h(x). So, h(-x) = h(x). That means h(x) is even. \n\nLet me recap to make sure. Starting with h(-x), substitute in, use the properties of f and g. Since g is odd, (-x)^3 is -x\u00b3, and then since f is even, f of negative something is just f of that something. So, h(-x) equals h(x), hence h is even. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in that reasoning. The key steps were recognizing that x\u00b3 is odd, so (-x)\u00b3 is -x\u00b3, then using the oddness of g to bring out the negative, and then the evenness of f to remove the negative. It all works out that h(-x) equals h(x).\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider specific examples to see if it makes sense. Suppose g(x) is something simple, like g(x) = x, which is odd. Then g(x\u00b3) = x\u00b3. So then f(g(x\u00b3)) = f(x\u00b3). Now, f is even, so f(-x\u00b3) = f(x\u00b3). Therefore, f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-x\u00b3) = f(x\u00b3) = f(g(x\u00b3)), which shows that h(-x) = h(x), confirming that h is even.\n\nAlternatively, take g(x) = x\u00b3, which is also odd. Then, g(x\u00b3) = x\u2079, which is also odd. Then, h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = f(x\u2079). Since f is even, plugging in x\u2079 or -x\u2079 doesn't change the value; f(x\u2079) = f(-x\u2079). Therefore, h(-x\u00b3) = f(-x\u2079) = f(x\u2079) = h(x\u00b3), so again h is even. \n\nWait, actually, no\u2014hold on, in this case, since h(-x) is f(g((-x)^3)) = f((-x)^3 * something). Wait, maybe examples can be tricky because the function might behave differently. Let me think of another example.\n\nSay f(x) is x\u00b2, which is even. Let g(x) be x\u00b3, which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) would be (x\u00b3)\u00b2 = x\u2076, which is even. Because f(g(-x\u00b3)) = (-x\u00b3)\u00b2 = x\u2076, which is same as f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nAnother example, f(x) = |x|, which is even. Take g(x) = x - x\u00b3, which is odd since -g(x) = -(x - x\u00b3) = -x + x\u00b3 = - (x - x\u00b3) = g(-x). So f(g(x\u00b3)) = |x\u00b3 - (x\u00b3)\u00b3| = |x\u00b3 - x\u2079|. Now, f(g(-x\u00b3)) = |(-x\u00b3) - (-x\u00b3)^3| = | -x\u00b3 - (-x\u2079)| = | -x\u00b3 + x\u2079 | = |x\u2079 -x\u00b3|. Since absolute value doesn't care about the sign, this is the same as |x\u00b3 - x\u2079| which is equal to f(g(x\u00b3)). So, h(-x\u00b3) = h(x\u00b3), meaning h is even.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So the conclusion is that in these cases, it seems to hold. So, probably the answer is even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\nAn even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) and an odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\nLet \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nTo determine if \\( h(x) \\) is even or odd, we evaluate \\( h(-x) \\):\n- \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\)\n- Since \\((-x)^3 = -x^3\\), we have \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\)\n- Because \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\), so \\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\)\n- Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\)\n\nThus, \\( h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\), which means \\( h(x) \\) is even.\n\nTherefore, the function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\(\\boxed{even}\\).<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>"

Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you multiply two polynomials, the degree of the resulting polynomial is the sum of the degrees of the two polynomials being multiplied. Here, the left side is (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) multiplied by p(x), and the right side is a fourth-degree polynomial, which is x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25. So, if I let the degree of p(x) be n, then 2 + n = 4 because the left side will have degree 2 + n. Therefore, n must be 2, which means p(x) is a quadratic polynomial. So, p(x) must be of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are constants that I need to find.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation: (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5)(ax\u00b2 + bx + c) = x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25. My job is to expand the left side and then compare the coefficients with the right side to find a, b, and c.\n\nLet me expand the left side step by step. I'll distribute each term in (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) across each term in (ax\u00b2 + bx + c):\n\nFirst, multiply x\u00b2 by each term in (ax\u00b2 + bx + c):\n- x\u00b2 * ax\u00b2 = a x\u2074\n- x\u00b2 * bx = b x\u00b3\n- x\u00b2 * c = c x\u00b2\n\nNext, multiply -3x by each term in (ax\u00b2 + bx + c):\n- -3x * ax\u00b2 = -3a x\u00b3\n- -3x * bx = -3b x\u00b2\n- -3x * c = -3c x\n\nThen, multiply 5 by each term in (ax\u00b2 + bx + c):\n- 5 * ax\u00b2 = 5a x\u00b2\n- 5 * bx = 5b x\n- 5 * c = 5c\n\nSo, combining all these terms, the left side becomes:\na x\u2074 + b x\u00b3 + c x\u00b2 - 3a x\u00b3 - 3b x\u00b2 - 3c x + 5a x\u00b2 + 5b x + 5c\n\nNow, I need to combine the like terms:\n\nFor x\u2074: a x\u2074\n\nFor x\u00b3: b x\u00b3 - 3a x\u00b3 = (b - 3a) x\u00b3\n\nFor x\u00b2: c x\u00b2 - 3b x\u00b2 + 5a x\u00b2 = (c - 3b + 5a) x\u00b2\n\nFor x: -3c x + 5b x = ( -3c + 5b ) x\n\nConstant term: 5c\n\nSo, putting it all together, the expanded form is:\na x\u2074 + (b - 3a) x\u00b3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x\u00b2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c\n\nNow, this should be equal to the right side, x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25.\n\nTherefore, we can set up equations by comparing coefficients for each power of x.\n\nLet me write down these equations:\n\n1. Coefficient of x\u2074: a = 1\n2. Coefficient of x\u00b3: b - 3a = -3\n3. Coefficient of x\u00b2: c - 3b + 5a = 0 (since there's no x\u00b2 term on the right side)\n4. Coefficient of x: (-3c + 5b) = 15\n5. Constant term: 5c = -25\n\nOkay, now I can solve these equations step by step.\n\nStarting with equation 1: a = 1. That gives me a = 1.\n\nPlug a = 1 into equation 2: b - 3(1) = -3 => b - 3 = -3. Adding 3 to both sides gives b = 0.\n\nNow, with a = 1 and b = 0, let's move to equation 3: c - 3(0) + 5(1) = 0 => c + 5 = 0 => c = -5.\n\nNow, check equation 4 with b = 0 and c = -5: (-3*(-5) + 5*0) = 15 + 0 = 15, which matches the right side (15). So, equation 4 is satisfied.\n\nFinally, equation 5: 5c = -25. With c = -5, let's check this: 5*(-5) = -25, which is correct.\n\nSo, all equations have been satisfied with a = 1, b = 0, c = -5. Therefore, the polynomial p(x) is ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 1x\u00b2 + 0x - 5, which simplifies to x\u00b2 - 5.\n\nLet me quickly double-check my solution by multiplying (x\u00b2 - 3x +5) by (x\u00b2 -5) to make sure I get x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25.\n\nMultiplying:\n\nFirst, x\u00b2 times x\u00b2 = x\u2074\n\nx\u00b2 times (-5) = -5x\u00b2\n\n-3x times x\u00b2 = -3x\u00b3\n\n-3x times (-5) = 15x\n\n5 times x\u00b2 = 5x\u00b2\n\n5 times (-5) = -25\n\nSo, combining:\n\nx\u2074\n\n-3x\u00b3\n\n-5x\u00b2 + 5x\u00b2 = 0x\u00b2\n\n15x\n\n-25\n\nSo, putting altogether: x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25, which is x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Perfect, that's exactly the right side. So, p(x) = x\u00b2 -5.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. Let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Also, just to be sure, is there any other way this could be approached?\n\nAnother possible method is polynomial division: divide x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x -25 by x\u00b2 -3x +5 and see if I get p(x).\n\nLet me try that.\n\nDivide x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25 by x\u00b2 -3x +5.\n\nSetting it up:\n\nDividend: x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +0x\u00b2 +15x -25\n\nDivisor: x\u00b2 -3x +5\n\nWe divide term by term.\n\nFirst term: x\u2074 divided by x\u00b2 is x\u00b2.\n\nMultiply divisor by x\u00b2: x\u00b2*(x\u00b2 -3x +5)=x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2\n\nSubtract this from the dividend:\n\n(x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +0x\u00b2 +15x -25) - (x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2) = 0x\u2074 +0x\u00b3 -5x\u00b2 +15x -25\n\nSo, now we have: -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nNext, divide this by the divisor x\u00b2 -3x +5. The leading term is -5x\u00b2 divided by x\u00b2 is -5.\n\nMultiply divisor by -5: -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nSubtract this from the current dividend:\n\n(-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) - (-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) = 0\n\nSo, no remainder. Thus, the quotient is x\u00b2 -5, which is exactly what I found earlier.\n\nOkay, that's another way to verify it, and the result is the same. So, p(x) is definitely x\u00b2 -5.\n\nWait, just one more check. Let me try synthetic division or another method.\n\nBut dividing a quartic by a quadratic, long division is probably straightforward, which I just did, and it worked.\n\nAlternatively, I can also try plugging in some values.\n\nLet me suppose p(x) = x\u00b2 -5, then when x=1, (1 -3 +5)p(1) = (3)(1 -5)=3*(-4)=-12; On the right side, x=1: 1 -3 +15 -25= (1-3)=-2, (15-25)=-10, so total is (-12). So, yes, it matches.\n\nAnother test, x=0: Left side: p(0)*(0 - 0 +5)=?\n\nWait, No, for x=0, plugging in, left side is (0 -0 +5)*p(0)=5*p(0). Right side is 0 -0 +0 -25 = -25. So, 5*p(0) = -25, which implies p(0)= -5. Looking at p(x)=x\u00b2 -5, p(0)=0 -5= -5, which is correct. That's consistent.\n\nTest another value: x=2. Left side: (4 -6 +5)*p(2)= (3)* (4 -5)=3*(-1)=-3.\n\nRight side: 16 -24 +30 -25= (16-24)= -8, (30-25)=5. So, (-8+5)= -3. Which matches. So, yeah, p(2) is 4-5=-1, and 3*(-1)= -3. That's good.\n\nHmm. Alright, I think I've verified it enough.\n\nThe polynomial p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\(\\boxed{x^2 - 5}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25\\), we start by noting that the degree of \\( p(x) \\) must be 2 since the product on the left side is a fourth-degree polynomial.

Hmm, let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that multiplying two polynomials should give me another polynomial. In this case, one of them is a quadratic (\\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\)) and when multiplied by \\( p(x) \\), it results in a quartic polynomial (\\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\)). So, that means \\( p(x) \\) must be a quadratic polynomial itself, right? Because when a quadratic multiplies another quadratic, you get a quartic.

My goal is to find these constants such that when I multiply \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) by \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), I get the given quartic polynomial.\n\nAlright, let's set up the multiplication. I'll write the product:\n\n\\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c) \\)\n\nI need to expand this and then set it equal to \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). Then, by equating the coefficients of like terms, I can solve for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nFirst, let's carry out the multiplication step by step. Let's expand term by term.\n\nMultiply \\( x^2 \\) by each term in \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\):\n- \\( x^2 * ax^2 = a x^4 \\)\n- \\( x^2 * bx = b x^3 \\)\n- \\( x^2 * c = c x^2 \\)\n\nNext, multiply \\( -3x \\) by each term in \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\):\n- \\( -3x * ax^2 = -3a x^3 \\)\n- \\( -3x * bx = -3b x^2 \\)\n- \\( -3x * c = -3c x \\)\n\nThen, multiply \\( 5 \\) by each term in \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\):\n- \\( 5 * ax^2 = 5a x^2 \\)\n- \\( 5 * bx = 5b x \\)\n- \\( 5 * c = 5c \\)\n\nNow, let's write down all these terms together:\n\n1. \\( a x^4 \\)\n2. \\( b x^3 \\)\n3. \\( c x^2 \\)\n4. \\( -3a x^3 \\)\n5. \\( -3b x^2 \\)\n6. \\( -3c x \\)\n7. \\( 5a x^2 \\)\n8. \\( 5b x \\)\n9. \\( 5c \\)\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\nFirst, for \\( x^4 \\):\n- Only term 1: \\( a x^4 \\)\n\nNext, \\( x^3 \\):\n- Term 2: \\( b x^3 \\)\n- Term 4: \\( -3a x^3 \\)\nSo, combined: \\( (b - 3a) x^3 \\)\n\nNext, \\( x^2 \\):\n- Term 3: \\( c x^2 \\)\n- Term 5: \\( -3b x^2 \\)\n- Term 7: \\( 5a x^2 \\)\nCombined: \\( (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 \\)\n\nNext, \\( x \\):\n- Term 6: \\( -3c x \\)\n- Term 8: \\( 5b x \\)\nCombined: \\( (-3c + 5b) x \\)\n\nFinally, constant term:\n- Term 9: \\( 5c \\)\n\nSo putting it all together, the product is:\n\n\\( a x^4 + (b - 3a) x^3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c \\)\n\nAnd this product equals the given quartic: \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nNow, let's set the coefficients equal for each power of \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, since the product must equal the given polynomial, their corresponding coefficients must match.\n\nStarting with the highest degree, which is \\( x^4 \\):\n\n1.

Interesting, so the linear term in \\( p(x) \\) is zero. That might have been expected or not; let me keep going.\n\nNext, coefficient of \\( x^2 \\):\n3. Coefficient in product: \\( c - 3b + 5a \\)\n   - Coefficient in given poly.: 0 (since there is no \\( x^2 \\) term, it's implicitly 0)\n   So, equation: \\( c - 3b + 5a = 0 \\)\n   Substitute \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\):\n   \\( c - 0 + 5(1) = 0 \\)\n   \\( c + 5 = 0 \\)\n   Therefore, \\( c = -5 \\)\n\nOkay, moving on to the coefficient of \\( x \\):\n\n4. Coefficient in product: \\( -3c + 5b \\)\n   - Coefficient in given poly.: 15\n   So, equation: \\( -3c + 5b = 15 \\)\n   Substitute \\( b = 0 \\) and \\( c = -5 \\):\n   \\( -3*(-5) + 5*0 = 15 \\)\n   \\( 15 + 0 = 15 \\)\n   That's good, 15=15, which is consistent.\n\nLastly, the constant term:\n\n5. Coefficient in product: \\( 5c \\)\n   - Coefficient in given poly.: -25\n   So, equation: \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n   Substitute \\( c = -5 \\):\n   \\( 5*(-5) = -25 \\)\n   \\( -25 = -25 \\)\n   Perfect, that works out.\n\nSo, in summary, we found:\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = 0 \\)\n- \\( c = -5 \\)\n\nTherefore, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is:\n\n\\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = 1x^2 + 0x + (-5) = x^2 - 5 \\)\n\nLet me just verify this to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's multiply \\( x^2 - 3x +5 \\) by \\( x^2 - 5 \\) and check if we get the given quartic.\n\nMultiplying them together:\n\nFirst, \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)(x^2 - 5) \\)\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\n1. \\( x^2 * x^2 = x^4 \\)\n2. \\( x^2 * (-5) = -5x^2 \\)\n3. \\( -3x * x^2 = -3x^3 \\)\n4. \\( -3x * (-5) = 15x \\)\n5. \\( 5 * x^2 = 5x^2 \\)\n6. \\( 5 * (-5) = -25 \\)\n\nCombine these terms:\n\n\\( x^4 - 5x^2 - 3x^3 + 15x + 5x^2 -25 \\)\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n- \\( x^4 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 \\)\n- \\( (-5x^2 + 5x^2) = 0x^2 \\)\n- \\( 15x \\)\n- \\( -25 \\)\n\nSo the result is:\n\n\\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x -25 \\)\n\nWhich is exactly the given polynomial.

Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\): \\( a = 1 \\)\n2. Coefficient of \\( x^3 \\): \\( b - 3a = -3 \\)\n3. Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\): \\( c - 3b + 5a = 0 \\)\n4.

Hmm, okay. So, essentially, I have the equation:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25\n\\]\n\nMy goal is to solve for \\( p(x) \\). I think a good way to approach this is by performing polynomial division, right? Because if I divide the right-hand side polynomial by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\), the result should be \\( p(x) \\). \n\nLet me recall how polynomial division works. It's kind of like long division with numbers, but involving polynomials. The steps are to divide the leading term of the dividend by the leading term of the divisor, multiply the entire divisor by that result, subtract from the dividend, and repeat the process with the new polynomial. \n\nSo first, let me write down the dividend and the divisor more clearly. The dividend is \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25 \\) because I notice that the original right-hand side didn't have an \\( x^2 \\) term, so I'll include a zero coefficient for that to make it easier. The divisor is \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\nLet me set up the long division:\n\nDividing \\( x^4 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) gives me \\( x^2 \\). So, I write \\( x^2 \\) above the division line. Then, I multiply \\( x^2 \\) by the divisor \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\), which gives me:\n\n\\( x^2 \\times x^2 = x^4 \\),\n\\( x^2 \\times (-3x) = -3x^3 \\),\n\\( x^2 \\times 5 = 5x^2 \\).\n\nSo, that gives \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).\n\nNext, I subtract this result from the original dividend:\n\n\\( (x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x -25) - (x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2) \\).\n\nLet me subtract term by term:\n\n- \\( x^4 - x^4 = 0 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 - (-3x^3) = 0 \\)\n- \\( 0x^2 - 5x^2 = -5x^2 \\)\n- \\( 15x - 0x = 15x \\)\n- \\( -25 - 0 = -25 \\)\n\nSo, the subtraction results in \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nNow, I bring down the remaining terms, but in this case, all terms have been accounted for, so the next dividend is \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nNow, I divide the leading term \\( -5x^2 \\) by the leading term of the divisor \\( x^2 \\), which is \\( -5 \\). So, I write \\( -5 \\) as the next term in the quotient.\n\nThen, I multiply \\( -5 \\) by the divisor \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\):\n\n\\( -5 \\times x^2 = -5x^2 \\),\n\\( -5 \\times (-3x) = 15x \\),\n\\( -5 \\times 5 = -25 \\).\n\nSo, that gives \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nAgain, I subtract this from the current polynomial:\n\n\\( (-5x^2 + 15x -25) - (-5x^2 + 15x -25) = 0 \\).\n\nSo, there's no remainder left, which is great. That means the division comes out perfectly, and the quotient is what I've found so far: \\( x^2 - 5 \\).\n\nWait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the beginning: I divided \\( x^4 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( x^2 \\), then multiplied \\( x^2 \\) by the divisor, got \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\), subtract that from \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25 \\), which gave me \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\). Then, I divided \\( -5x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( -5 \\), multiplied it by the divisor: \\( -5x^2 +15x -25 \\), and subtracted to get a remainder of 0. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the polynomial \\( p(x) = x^2 - 5 \\). Let me just verify by multiplying \\( x^2 - 3x +5 \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\) to see if I get the original polynomial.\n\nLet me perform this multiplication:\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( x^4 \\).\n\nThen \\( x^2 \\times -5 \\) gives \\( -5x^2 \\).\n\nNow, multiply \\( -3x \\) by \\( x^2 \\): \\( -3x^3 \\).\n\nThen, \\( -3x \\times -5 \\): \\( +15x \\).\n\nNext, \\( 5 \\times x^2 \\): \\( 5x^2 \\).\n\n\\( 5 \\times -5 \\): \\( -25 \\).\n\nSo now, writing all these terms together:\n\n\\( x^4 -5x^2 -3x^3 +15x +5x^2 -25 \\).\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\n\\( x^4 -3x^3 + (-5x^2 +5x^2) +15x -25 \\).\n\nSimplifies to:\n\n\\( x^4 -3x^3 + 0x^2 +15x -25 \\).\n\nWhich is exactly \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\), which is the given polynomial. \n\nSo, that confirms that when I multiply \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\), I indeed get the desired result.\n\nTherefore, I think my solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25,\n\\]\n\nwe perform polynomial long division of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n1. Divide the leading term \\( x^4 \\) by the leading term \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( x^2 \\).\n2. Multiply \\( x^2 \\) by the divisor \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) to get \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).\n3. Subtract this result from the original polynomial:\n   \\[\n   (x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25) - (x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2) = -5x^2 + 15x - 25.\n   \\]\n4. Divide the leading term \\( -5x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( -5 \\).\n5. Multiply \\( -5 \\) by the divisor \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) to get \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\).\n6. Subtract this result from the previous remainder:\n   \\[\n   (-5x^2 + 15x - 25) - (-5x^2 + 15x - 25) = 0.\n   \\]\n\nThe quotient from the division is \\( x^2 - 5 \\), and there is no remainder.

Let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that if I have two polynomials multiplied together and the result is another polynomial, the degrees of the polynomials should add up. Let me check, the degree of \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) is 2, and we're looking for \\( p(x) \\). The product is \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\), which is a degree 4 polynomial. So, since \\( 2 + \\text{degree of } p = 4 \\), the degree of \\( p(x) \\) must be \\( 2 \\). That makes sense. So \\( p(x) \\) is a quadratic polynomial.\n\nLet me denote \\( p(x) \\) as \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants that I need to find. \n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x -25 \\)\n\nAlright, now I need to multiply out the left-hand side and then equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \\( x \\) to the right-hand side. That way, I can set up equations for each coefficient and solve for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nLet me multiply \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) by \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\):\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 \\) by each term in \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\):\n- \\( x^2 \\times ax^2 = a x^4 \\)\n- \\( x^2 \\times bx = b x^3 \\)\n- \\( x^2 \\times c = c x^2 \\)\n\nNext, multiply \\( -3x \\) by each term:\n- \\( -3x \\times ax^2 = -3a x^3 \\)\n- \\( -3x \\times bx = -3b x^2 \\)\n- \\( -3x \\times c = -3c x \\)\n\nThen, multiply \\( 5 \\) by each term:\n- \\( 5 \\times ax^2 = 5a x^2 \\)\n- \\( 5 \\times bx = 5b x \\)\n- \\( 5 \\times c = 5c \\)\n\nNow let's write all these terms out:\n\n1. \\( a x^4 \\)\n2. \\( b x^3 + (-3a) x^3 \\) [since \\( b x^3 - 3a x^3 \\)]\n3. \\( c x^2 + (-3b) x^2 + 5a x^2 \\) [since \\( c x^2 - 3b x^2 + 5a x^2 \\)]\n4. \\( (-3c x) + (5b x) = (5b - 3c) x \\)\n5. Constant term: \\(5c\\)\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\n- The \\( x^4 \\) term: \\( a \\)\n- The \\( x^3 \\) terms: \\( (b - 3a) \\)\n- The \\( x^2 \\) terms: \\( (c - 3b + 5a) \\)\n- The \\( x \\) term: \\( (5b - 3c) \\)\n- Constant term: \\(5c\\)\n\nSo, when we write it all together, the left-hand side becomes:\n\n\\( (a)x^4 + (b - 3a)x^3 + (c - 3b + 5a)x^2 + (5b - 3c)x + 5c \\)\n\nNow, let's equate this to the right-hand side, which is \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\).\n\nThat means:\n\n1.

Constant term: \\(5c = -25\\)\n\nAlright, now we have a system of equations:\n\n1. \\( a = 1 \\)  \n2. \\( b - 3a = -3 \\)  \n3. \\( c - 3b + 5a = 0 \\)  \n4. \\( 5b - 3c = 15 \\)  \n5. \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\nLet me start solving this step by step.\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( a = 1 \\).

Let's plug this into another equation. Equation 4: \\( 5b - 3c = 15 \\).\n\nSubstitute \\( c = -5 \\) into equation 4:\n\\( 5b - 3*(-5) = 15 \\)\nSimplify: \\(5b + 15 = 15\\)\nSubtract 15 from both sides: \\(5b = 0\\)\nTherefore, \\( b = 0 /5 = 0 \\)\n\nSo, \\( b = 0 \\).\n\nNow, we can use equation 2 to see if this is consistent.\n\nEquation 2: \\( b - 3a = -3 \\)\nWe have \\( b = 0 \\) and \\( a =1 \\)\nSo, \\( 0 - 3(1) = -3 \\) \u2192 \\( -3 = -3 \\).

Let me write down that equation:\n\n\\[\na x^{4} + (-3a + b) x^{3} + (5a - 3b + c)x^{2} + (5b - 3c) x + 5c = x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25\n\\]\n\nWait a second, technically, the right-hand side doesn't show \\( x^2 \\) term, but technically, it's there with a coefficient of 0. That might be an important point. So, to properly set up the equations, I should compare coefficients for each degree.\n\nTherefore, the coefficients of corresponding powers must be equal. So, let's set them aside:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\):\n   \\( a = 1 \\) (Because RHS has 1 coefficient for \\( x^4 \\))\n\n2. Coefficient of \\( x^3 \\):\n   \\( -3a + b = -3 \\)\n\n3. Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\):\n   \\( 5a - 3b + c = 0 \\)\n\n4. Coefficient of \\( x \\):\n   \\( 5b - 3c = 15 \\)\n\n5. Constant term:\n   \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\nNow, that gives me a system of equations:\n\n1. \\( a = 1 \\)\n\n2. \\( -3a + b = -3 \\)\n\n3. \\( 5a - 3b + c = 0 \\)\n\n4. \\( 5b - 3c = 15 \\)\n\n5. \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\nAlright, let's solve this step by step.\n\nStarting with equation 1: \\( a = 1 \\). That\u2019s straightforward.\n\nMoving to equation 5: \\( 5c = -25 \\). Dividing both sides by 5, we get \\( c = -5 \\). So that gives us the value of \\( c \\).\n\nNow, let's plug \\( c = -5 \\) into equation 4: \\( 5b - 3c = 15 \\). Substituting:\n\n\\( 5b - 3*(-5) = 15 \\)\n\nCalculates to:\n\n\\( 5b + 15 = 15 \\)\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides: \\( 5b = 0 \\), so \\( b = 0 \\).\n\nOkay, now we have \\( b = 0 \\) and \\( c = -5 \\). Let's plug \\( a = 1 \\) into equation 2 to get \\( b \\). Wait, \\( a = 1 \\) and equation 2 is \\( -3a + b = -3 \\):\n\nSo, substituting \\( a = 1 \\):\n\n\\( -3(1) + b = -3 \\)\n\\( -3 + b = -3 \\)\nAdding 3 to both sides: \\( b = 0 \\). Okay, that matches the result from equation 4. Good, no contradictions there.\n\nNow, let's check equation 3: \\( 5a - 3b + c = 0 \\)\n\nWe know \\( a=1 \\), \\( b=0 \\), and \\( c=-5 \\):\n\n\\( 5(1) - 3(0) + (-5) = 5 - 0 -5 = 0 \\). Exactly, so equation 3 is satisfied.\n\nThus, all equations are consistent, and we have our values:\n\n\\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), \\( c = -5 \\)\n\nSo, putting it all together, the quadratic polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is:\n\n\\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = 1x^2 + 0x -5 = x^2 -5 \\)\n\nWait, hold on a moment. Let me just verify that to make sure we don't have a mistake.\n\nLet me compute \\( (x^2 - 3x +5)(x^2 -5) \\) and see if it equals \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\): that's \\( x^4 -5x^2 \\)\n\nNext, multiply \\( -3x \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\): that's \\( -3x^3 +15x \\)\n\nThen, multiply \\(5 \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\): that's \\( 5x^2 -25 \\)\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n\\( x^4 -5x^2 -3x^3 +15x +5x^2 -25 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- \\( x^4 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 \\)\n- \\( (-5x^2 +5x^2) = 0x^2 \\)\n- \\(15x \\)\n- \\( -25 \\)\n\nSo, the result is \\( x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25 \\). Which simplifies to \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\), which is exactly the polynomial we wanted. Perfect, so our solution is correct.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe we can perform polynomial long division as another method to see if \\( (x^2 - 3x +5) \\) divides into \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\) evenly, giving us \\( p(x) \\) as a quadratic.\n\nSo, if I perform \\( \\frac{x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25}{x^2 -3x +5} \\), the result should be \\( x^2 +0x -5 \\), which is \\( x^2 -5 \\).\n\nLet me set up the division:\n\nDivide \\( x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25 \\) by \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\).\n\n1. How many times does \\( x^2 \\) go into \\( x^4 \\)? It's \\( x^2 \\). Multiply \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\), which is \\( x^4 -3x^3 +5x^2 \\).\n\n2. Subtract this from the dividend:\n\n\\( (x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25) - (x^4 -3x^3 +5x^2) = 0x^4 +0x^3 -5x^2 +15x -25 \\)\n\n3. Now, bring down the next terms\u2014but here, all the coefficients are there, so move on.\n\n4. How many times does \\( x^2 \\) go into \\( -5x^2 \\)? It's \\(-5\\). Multiply \\( -5 \\) by \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\), which is \\( -5x^2 +15x -25 \\).\n\n5. Subtract this from the current dividend:\n\n\\( (-5x^2 +15x -25) - (-5x^2 +15x -25) = 0x^2 +0x +0 \\)\n\nSo, no remainder, which is perfect, and the quotient is \\( x^2 -5 \\), which again matches our previous result. So it's double-checked.\n\nAlternatively, if I am unsure, maybe I can try plugging in some values to see if both sides are equal.\n\nFor instance, let\u2019s pick x = 1.\n\nCompute LHS: \\( (1^2 -3*1 +5)(1^2 -5) = (1 -3 +5)(1 -5) = (3)(-4) = -12 \\)\n\nCompute RHS: \\(1^4 -3*1^3 +15*1 -25 =1 -3 +15 -25= (1 -3) + (15 -25) = (-2) + (-10)= -12 \\). So that works.\n\nLet me try another value, say x=2.\n\nCompute LHS: \\( (4 -6 +5)(4 -5)= (3)(-1)= -3 \\)\n\nCompute RHS: 16 -24 +30 -25= (16-24) + (30-25)= (-8)+(5)= -3. That works too.\n\nHow about x=0? Let me see.\n\nLHS: \\( (0 -0 +5)(0 -5)=5*(-5)= -25 \\)\n\nRHS: 0 +0 +0 -25= -25. That matches as well.\n\nAnother test at x= -1.\n\nLHS: (1 +3 +5)(1 -5)=9*(-4)= -36\n\nRHS: 1 +3 + (-15) -25=1 +3 -15 -25= 4 -40= -36. Perfect.\n\nSo, all tests are passing, confirming that our polynomial \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\nIs there another way to approach",

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I know that \\( p(x) \\) must be a polynomial because both \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) \\) and the result are polynomials. So, if I have a polynomial multiplied by a quadratic to get a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, that means \\( p(x) \\) must be a quadratic as well. Because if you multiply a quadratic by a quadratic, the highest degree term is 4. So, that suggests \\( p(x) \\) is a quadratic polynomial. \n\nLet me write that down. So, let me denote \\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants that I need to find. Got that.\n\nNow, the equation is \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). My task is to expand the left-hand side and then equate the coefficients with the right-hand side to find \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nSo, I'm going to proceed to expand \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c) \\).\n\nLet me recall that polynomial multiplication is done term by term. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and then like terms are combined.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n1. Multiply \\( x^2 \\) from the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\( x^2 \\cdot ax^2 = a x^{2+2} = a x^4 \\)\n   - \\( x^2 \\cdot bx = b x^{2+1} = b x^3 \\)\n   - \\( x^2 \\cdot c = c x^2 \\)\n\n2. Multiply \\( -3x \\) from the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\( -3x \\cdot ax^2 = -3a x^{1+2} = -3a x^3 \\)\n   - \\( -3x \\cdot bx = -3b x^{1+1} = -3b x^2 \\)\n   - \\( -3x \\cdot c = -3c x \\)\n\n3. Multiply \\( 5 \\) from the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\( 5 \\cdot ax^2 = 5a x^2 \\)\n   - \\( 5 \\cdot bx = 5b x \\)\n   - \\( 5 \\cdot c = 5c \\)\n\nNow, let me add up all these terms:\n\n- The \\( x^4 \\) term: \\( a x^4 \\)\n- The \\( x^3 \\) terms: \\( b x^3 - 3a x^3 \\) which combines to \\( (b - 3a) x^3 \\)\n- The \\( x^2 \\) terms: \\( c x^2 - 3b x^2 + 5a x^2 \\) which combines to \\( (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 \\)\n- The \\( x \\) terms: \\( -3c x + 5b x \\) which combines to \\( (-3c + 5b) x \\)\n- The constant term is \\( 5c \\ )\n\nSo, putting it all together, the expanded left-hand side becomes:\n\\( a x^4 + (b - 3a) x^3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c \\)\n\nNow, this must equal the right-hand side, which is \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). \n\nSo, let's write out the equation:\n\n\\[\na x^4 + (b - 3a) x^3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c = x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25\n\\]\n\nWait, hold on. When writing polynomials, the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) in the right-hand side is zero because there's no \\( x^2 \\) term. So I added \\( 0x^2 \\) to represent that. Similarly, the constants are 15 for \\( x \\) and -25 as the constant term.\n\nNow, since two polynomials are equal if and only if their corresponding coefficients of like terms are equal. So, let's set up equations for each coefficient:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\):\n   \\( a = 1 \\)\n\n2. Coefficient of \\( x^3 \\):\n   \\( b - 3a = -3 \\)\n\n3. Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\):\n   \\( c - 3b + 5a = 0 \\)\n\n4. Coefficient of \\( x \\):\n   \\( -3c + 5b = 15 \\)\n\n5. Constant term:\n   \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\nOkay, so now I have a system of equations to solve for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), \\( c \\).\n\nLet's solve step by step.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\\( a = 1 \\)\n\nPlugging this into equation 2:\n\\( b - 3(1) = -3 \\)\n\\( b - 3 = -3 \\)\nAdding 3 to both sides:\n\\( b = 0 \\)\n\nNow, plug \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\) into equation 3:\n\n\\( c - 3(0) + 5(1) = 0 \\)\nSimplify:\n\\( c - 0 + 5 = 0 \\)\n\\( c + 5 = 0 \\)\nSubtract 5:\n\\( c = -5 \\)\n\nThen, let's check equation 4:\n\\( -3c + 5b = 15 \\)\nPlugging \\( c = -5 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\):\n\\( -3(-5) + 5(0) = 15 \\)\nSimplify:\n15 + 0 = 15\n15 = 15. Okay, that's consistent.\n\nFinally, equation 5:\n\\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\\( c = -5 \\)\nWhich is the same result as above.\n\nSo, all equations are consistent, and we've got \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), \\( c = -5 \\).\n\nTherefore, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is:\n\n\\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = 1x^2 + 0x -5 = x^2 -5 \\)\n\nWait a minute, so \\( p(x) \\) is \\( x^2 - 5 \\)? Let me verify that.\n\nLet me multiply \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) \\) by \\( (x^2 -5) \\):\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 \\cdot x^2 = x^4 \\)\n\n\\( x^2 \\cdot (-5) = -5x^2 \\)\n\nThen, \\( -3x \\cdot x^2 = -3x^3 \\)\n\n\\( -3x \\cdot (-5) = 15x \\)\n\nThen, \\( 5 \\cdot x^2 = 5x^2 \\)\n\n\\( 5 \\cdot (-5) = -25 \\)\n\nNow, let me add all these together:\n\n- \\( x^4 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 \\)\n- \\( -5x^2 + 5x^2 = 0x^2 \\)\n- \\( 15x \\)\n- \\( -25 \\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x -25 \\), which is exactly the given polynomial.\n\nSo, indeed, \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\) is the correct polynomial.\n\nBut, just to double-check, maybe do the multiplication in a different way, maybe vertically.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n      x^2 - 3x + 5\n    *    x^2 - 5\n    ---------------\nMultiply each term:\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 -5 \\) by 5: 5*(x^2 -5) = 5x^2 -25\n\nThen, multiply \\( x^2 -5 \\) by (-3x): -3x*(x^2 -5) = -3x^3 +15x\n\nThen, multiply \\( x^2 -5 \\) by x^2: x^2*(x^2 -5) = x^4 -5x^2\n\nNow, add them all up:\n\nFirst term: x^4 -5x^2\nSecond term: -3x^3 +15x\nThird term: 5x^2 -25\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx^4: 1x^4\nx^3: -3x^3\nx^2: -5x^2 +5x^2 = 0\nx terms: 15x\nconstants: -25\n\nSo altogether:\nx^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 which matches.\n\nSo yeah, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use polynomial division? Let me think.\n\nIf I have \\( (x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25) \\) divided by \\( (x^2 -3x +5) \\), I should get \\( p(x) \\). Maybe checking through polynomial division.\n\nSo, dividing \\( x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25 \\) by \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\). Hmm.\n\nSet it up like polynomial long division:\n\nDividing \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 +15x -25 \\) by \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\)\n\nFirst term: \\( x^4 \\) divided by \\( x^2 \\) gives \\( x^2 \\). So, multiply divisor \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\) by \\( x^2 \\), giving \\( x^4 -3x^3 +5x^2 \\)\n\nSubtract that from the dividend:\n\n\\( (x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25 ) - (x^4 -3x^3 +5x^2 ) = 0x^4 +0x^3 -5x^2 +15x -25 \\)\n\nSo now, the remainder is \\( -5x^2 +15x -25 \\)\n\nNext term: Divide \\( -5x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) gives -5. Multiply divisor by -5: \\( -5x^2 +15x -25 \\)\n\nSubtracting this from the current remainder:\n\n\\( (-5x^2 +15x -25 ) - (-5x^2 +15x -25 ) = 0 \\)\n\nSo, the remainder is zero, and the quotient is \\( x^2 -5 \\).\n\nHence, \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\) which confirms the earlier result. \n\nWait, doing polynomial division helped solidify that. So yeah, whether I do the expansion and equate coefficients, or I do the polynomial division, both methods point to \\( p(x) being equal to \\( x^2 -5 \\ ). \n\nSo, to recap:\n\nGiven equation \\( (x^2 -3x +5)p(x) = x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\), we determined that \\( p(x) \\) must be quadratic, expressed it as \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), expanded the product, equated coefficients with the given quartic, solved the system, found \\( a=1 \\), \\( b=0 \\), \\( c=-5 \\), hence \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\). Then, double-checked using multiplication, and through polynomial division as an additional verification. \n\nTherefore, the solution is consistent and correct. No steps seem missing or miscalculated. I think this is the accurate answer. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\), we start by noting that \\( p(x) \\) must be a quadratic polynomial.

Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if I have two polynomials multiplied together resulting in another polynomial, I can use polynomial division to find one polynomial if I know the other. In this case, I have the divisor (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) and the dividend is the result, which is x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25. So, I guess I need to divide x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25 by (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) to get p(x).\n\nLet me write this out: p(x) = (x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25) divided by (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5). Dividing polynomials usually involves polynomial long division. I've heard of this before; it's similar to dividing numbers, but with polynomials. I need to make sure I line up the terms properly.\n\nFirst, let me write both polynomials with their degrees in order. The dividend is a quartic (degree 4), and the divisor is a quadratic (degree 2). So, in long division, the divisor goes into the dividend.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2003_______________\nx\u00b2 - 3x + 5 ) x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25\n\nWait, I notice that in the dividend, there's no x\u00b2 term. So I should insert a placeholder with coefficient zero to make it easier. So, the dividend becomes x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nNow, I'll start the division.\n\nFirst term: x\u2074 divided by x\u00b2 is x\u00b2. So, the first term of the quotient is x\u00b2.\n\nMultiply the entire divisor by x\u00b2: x\u00b2*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2.\n\nSubtract this from the dividend:\n\n(x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25) - (x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2) =\n\nx\u2074 - x\u2074 = 0\n\n-3x\u00b3 - (-3x\u00b3) = 0\n\n0x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 = -5x\u00b2\n\n15x remains.\n\n-25 remains.\n\nSo now, the new polynomial is -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nBring down the terms, but since we've subtracted completely, the next step is to divide this new polynomial by the divisor.\n\nNext term: -5x\u00b2 divided by x\u00b2 is -5.\n\nMultiply the divisor by -5: -5*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nSubtract this from the current polynomial:\n\n(-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) - (-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) = 0\n\nSo, there's no remainder.\n\nSo, adding the two terms, x\u00b2 and -5, gives the quotient as x\u00b2 -5.\n\nTherefore, p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\nLet me check if that's correct. Multiply p(x) by (x\u00b2 -3x +5) and see if we get x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25.\n\nWell, (x\u00b2 -5)(x\u00b2 -3x +5).\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nx\u00b2*(x\u00b2) = x\u2074\n\nx\u00b2*(-3x) = -3x\u00b3\n\nx\u00b2*5 =5x\u00b2\n\n-5*(x\u00b2) = -5x\u00b2\n\n-5*(-3x)=15x\n\n-5*5 = -25\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx\u2074\n\n-3x\u00b3\n\n5x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 =0x\u00b2\n\n15x\n\n-25\n\nSo, we get x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 +0x\u00b2 +15x -25, which is equal to the given dividend x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +0x\u00b2 +15x -25. That checks out. So p(x) is indeed x\u00b2 -5. Cool.\n\nWait, let me recap the division steps because I want to make sure I didn't make any mistake there.\n\n1. Checked if I have all the missing terms with zero coefficients, which I did.\n\n2. First term: x\u2074 divided by x\u00b2 is x\u00b2. Multiply divisor by x\u00b2 gives x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2.\n\n3. Subtracted that, got 0 for x\u2074 and x\u00b3, -5x\u00b2 remains because 0x\u00b2 was there and 5x\u00b2 was subtracted.\n\n4. Then, next term is -5x\u00b2 /x\u00b2 is -5. Multiply divisor by -5, which is -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\n5. Subtract that from the current -5x\u00b2 +15x -25, and everything cancels out, remainder zero.\n\nSo, quotient is x\u00b2 -5. Therefore, p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\nI was a bit nervous when subtracting the polynomials, but breaking it down step by step seems to hold. Let me just visualize the multiplication again:\n\n(x\u00b2 -5)(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = x\u00b2*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) -5*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 +15x -25. As you can see, 5x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 cancels, and then you're left with x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25, which is exactly the given polynomial.\n\nSo, yeah, I think I'm confident that p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25\\), we perform polynomial long division of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n1. **Set up the division**: Divide \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n2. **First term**: \\( x^4 \\) divided by \\( x^2 \\) gives \\( x^2 \\).\n3. **Multiply and subtract**: Multiply \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) to get \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).

Hmm, interesting. I'm going to need to figure out what p(x) is. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that if I have two polynomials multiplied together and that their product is given, I can find the unknown polynomial by division. So p(x) must be the result when I divide x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25 by x\u00b2 - 3x + 5. That makes sense because polynomial division is like the opposite of multiplication. So I can set this up as a long division problem.\n\nAlright, let me write down the division. The dividend is x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 + 15x - 25, wait, why 0x\u00b2? Oh, because in the original polynomial x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25, the x\u00b2 term is missing. So I need to include a zero coefficient for that term to make the division accurate. Otherwise, I might misalign terms later on.\n\nSo, the divisor is x\u00b2 - 3x + 5. Let's set up the long division: \n\nWe start by dividing the first term of the dividend, which is x\u2074, by the first term of the divisor, which is x\u00b2. That gives x\u00b2. So, the first term of the quotient is x\u00b2. Now, multiply the entire divisor by x\u00b2 to get x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 5x\u00b2. \n\nSubtracting this from the dividend, we have:\n\n(x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 + 15x - 25) minus (x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 5x\u00b2) equals 0x\u2074 + 0x\u00b3 -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nSo now, the new polynomial to work with is -5x\u00b2 +15x -25. Now, we take the first term of this, which is -5x\u00b2, and divide it by the first term of the divisor, which is x\u00b2. That gives us -5. So, the next term in the quotient is -5.\n\nMultiply the divisor by -5: -5x\u00b2 +15x -25. Subtract that from our current polynomial:\n\n(-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) minus (-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) equals 0x\u00b2 +0x +0.\n\nOh, wow, that subtracted perfectly with no remainder. So putting it all together, the quotient is x\u00b2 -5, and the remainder is zero, which is exactly what we needed. So p(x) must be x\u00b2 -5.\n\nBut wait, hold on a second. Let me just verify that I did everything correctly because sometimes math can be tricky. So, we constructed p(x) as x\u00b2 -5 and multiplied it by (x\u00b2 -3x +5) to see if we get the original polynomial.\n\nLet me do that multiplication step by step:\n\n(x\u00b2 -5)(x\u00b2 -3x +5). Let's distribute each term:\n\nFirst, x\u00b2*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2.\n\nThen, -5*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nNow, add those two results together:\n\nx\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-5x\u00b2 +5x\u00b2 cancels out, so 0x\u00b2. Then, we have x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Which is exactly the right-hand side of the equation given. That checks out.\n\nSo yes, p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25\\), we need to perform polynomial division of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n1. **Set up the division**: The dividend is \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25 \\) (including a placeholder for the missing \\( x^2 \\) term) and the divisor is \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n2. **First term of the quotient**: Divide the first term of the dividend \\( x^4 \\) by the first term of the divisor \\( x^2 \\), giving \\( x^2 \\).\n\n3. **Multiply and subtract**: Multiply the entire divisor by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).

It's similar to long division with numbers. So, I can start by writing it out step by step. First, I need to divide \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x -25 \\) (since there's no \\( x^2 \\) term) by \\( x^2 - 3x +5 \\).\n\nLet me set it up:\n\nDividend: \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x -25 \\)\nDivisor: \\( x^2 - 3x +5 \\)\n\nI start by dividing the leading term of the dividend \\( x^4 \\) by the leading term of the divisor \\( x^2 \\). That gives me \\( x^2 \\). So, the first term of the quotient is \\( x^2 \\).\n\nNext, I multiply the entire divisor \\( x^2 - 3x +5 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) and subtract it from the dividend.\n\nMultiplying:\n\\( x^2 \\times (x^2 - 3x +5) = x^4 - 3x^3 +5x^2 \\).\n\nSubtracting that from the dividend:\n\\( (x^4 - 3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25) - (x^4 - 3x^3 +5x^2) \\).\n\nLet's do the subtraction term by term:\n- \\( x^4 - x^4 = 0 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 - (-3x^3) = 0 \\)\n- \\( 0x^2 - 5x^2 = -5x^2 \\)\n- \\( 15x - 0 = 15x \\)\n- \\( -25 - 0 = -25 \\)\n\nSo, after subtraction, the new polynomial is \\( -5x^2 +15x -25 \\).\n\nNow, I repeat the process. I divide the leading term \\( -5x^2 \\) by the leading term of the divisor \\( x^2 \\), which gives me \\( -5 \\). So, the next term in the quotient is \\( -5 \\).\n\nMultiply the divisor \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\) by \\( -5 \\):\n\\( -5 \\times (x^2 -3x +5) = -5x^2 +15x -25 \\).\n\nSubtracting this from the current polynomial:\n\\( (-5x^2 +15x -25 ) - (-5x^2 +15x -25) \\).\n\nCalculating term by term:\n- \\( -5x^2 - (-5x^2) = 0 \\)\n- \\( 15x - 15x = 0 \\)\n- \\( -25 - (-25) = 0 \\)\n\nSo, the remainder is zero. That means we're done.\n\nAdding up the terms we obtained in the quotient: \\( x^2 -5 \\). So, \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\).\n\nWait a second, let me check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I divided \\( x^4 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) and got \\( x^2 \\). That seems right. Then when I multiplied and subtracted, I correctly obtained \\( -5x^2 +15x -25 \\). Then dividing that by \\( x^2 \\) gave me \\( -5 \\). Multiplying again by the divisor gave me exactly the same terms to subtract, and hence zero remainder.\n\nSo, that seems correct. After double-checking, I think my calculations are accurate.\n\nAlternatively, I can verify by multiplying \\( x^2 -5 \\) by the divisor \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\) to see if we get back the given quartic polynomial.\n\nMultiplying \\( (x^2 -5)(x^2 -3x +5) \\):\n\nFirst, \\( x^2 \\times x^2 = x^4 \\)\nThen, \\( x^2 \\times (-3x) = -3x^3 \\)\nNext, \\( x^2 \\times 5 = 5x^2 \\)\nThen, \\( -5 \\times x^2 = -5x^2 \\)\n\\( -5 \\times (-3x) = 15x \\)\n\\( -5 \\times 5 = -25 \\)\n\nAdding up all these terms:\n\\( x^4 -3x^3 +5x^2 -5x^2 +15x -25 \\)\n\nSimplifying:\n- \\( x^4 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 \\ )\n- \\( 5x^2 -5x^2 = 0 \\)\n- \\( +15x \\)\n- \\( -25 \\)\n\nSo, the product is \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\), which is exactly the polynomial given in the problem.

Hmm, polynomial division? Or maybe factoring? Let me think.\n\nFirst, I know that if I have two polynomials multiplied together resulting in another polynomial, then I can solve for \\( p(x) \\) by dividing the resulting polynomial by the known polynomial. In this case, \\( p(x) \\) should be equal to \\( \\frac{x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25}{x^2 - 3x + 5} \\). That makes sense because division undoes multiplication.\n\nSo, maybe I can perform polynomial long division here. Let me set it up. I need to divide \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\). Let me write down the dividend and the divisor.\n\nDividing \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\). I notice that for clarity, I added a placeholder term \\( 0x^2 \\) for the missing \\( x^2 \\) term in the dividend. That way, I can systematically perform the division.\n\nOkay, starting with the first term of the dividend, \\( x^4 \\), and dividing it by the first term of the divisor, \\( x^2 \\). That gives me \\( x^2 \\). So, \\( x^2 \\) is the first term of the quotient \\( p(x) \\).\n\nNow, I multiply the entire divisor \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) which gives \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).\n\nNext, I subtract this result from the original dividend:\n\n\\( (x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25) - (x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2) \\)\n\nSubtracting term by term:\n\n- \\( x^4 - x^4 = 0 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 - (-3x^3) = 0 \\)\n- \\( 0x^2 - 5x^2 = -5x^2 \\)\n- \\( 15x - 0 = 15x \\)\n- \\( -25 - 0 = -25 \\)\n\nSo, the new polynomial after subtraction is \\( -5x^2 + 15x -25 \\).\n\nNow, I repeat the process with this new polynomial. Divide the first term \\( -5x^2 \\) by the first term of the divisor \\( x^2 \\), which gives me \\( -5 \\). So, the next term of the quotient is \\( -5 \\).\n\nNow, multiply the entire divisor by \\( -5 \\):\n\n\\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) * (-5) = -5x^2 + 15x -25 \\).\n\nSubtracting this from the previous remainder:\n\n\\( (-5x^2 +15x -25 ) - (-5x^2 +15x -25 ) \\)\n\nSubtracting term by term:\n\n- \\( -5x^2 - (-5x^2) = 0 \\)\n- \\( 15x -15x = 0 \\)\n- \\( -25 - (-25) =0 \\)\n\nSo, the remainder is 0.\n\nTherefore, the division is exact, and the quotient is the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) which we found through division. The quotient started as \\( x^2 \\) and then became \\( x^2 -5 \\) after the next term.\n\nSo, putting it all together, \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\).\n\nWait, let me verify this. If I multiply \\( (x^2 -3x +5) \\) by \\( (x^2 -5) \\), do I get \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\)?\n\nMultiplying \\( x^2 * x^2 = x^4 \\).\nThen, \\( x^2 * (-5) = -5x^2 \\).\nNext, \\( -3x * x^2 = -3x^3 \\).\nThen, \\( -3x * (-5) = 15x \\).\nNow, \\(5* x^2 =5x^2\\).\nThen,5* (-5) = -25.\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n- \\( x^4 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 \\)\n- \\( -5x^2 +5x^2 = 0x^2 \\)\n- \\( +15x \\)\n- \\( -25 \\)\n\nSo, the product is \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\), which is exactly what was given. Therefore, the division was correct, and p(x) is indeed \\( x^2 -5 \\).\n\nAnother way I thought about this problem is by factoring. I know that if we have \\( (x^2 -3x +5)p(x) = x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\), maybe we can factor the right-hand side. Sometimes factoring can reveal the structure needed.\n\nLet me try to factor \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\). Hmm, factoring quartic polynomials can be tricky, but maybe it's a product of quadratics or something. Alternatively, perhaps it can be factored as the product of \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\) and another quadratic. Let me check.\n\nLet\u2019s assume \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 = (x^2 -3x +5)(px^2 + qx + r) \\). If I can find p, q, r such that this holds, then that will help me get p(x). Alternatively, p is the quadratic we just found, but to see whether this works.\n\nMultiplying out the right-hand side:\n\n\\( (x^2 -3x +5)(px^2 + qx + r) \\)\n= \\( x^2(px^2 + qx + r) -3x(px^2 + qx + r) + 5(px^2 + qx + r) \\)\n= \\( px^4 + qx^3 + rx^2 -3px^3 -3qx^2 -3rx +5px^2 +5qx +5r \\)\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\n- \\( x^4: p \\)\n- \\( x^3: q -3p \\)\n- \\( x^2: r -3q +5p \\)\n- \\( x: -3r +5q \\)\n- Constant term: 5r\n\nNow, the left-hand side is \\( x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25 \\). So, setting up equations by equating coefficients:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\): p =1\n2. Coefficient of \\( x^3 \\): q -3p = -3\n3. Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\): r -3q +5p =0\n4. Coefficient of \\( x \\): -3r +5q =15\n5. Constant term: 5r = -25\n\nSo, let's solve these equations:\n\nFrom equation 1: p =1\n\nFrom equation 2: q -3(1) = -3 \u2192 q -3 = -3 \u2192 q=0\n\nFrom equation 5: 5r = -25 \u2192 r = -5\n\nNow, from equation 3: r -3q +5p = (-5) -0 +5(1) =0? Let's test:\n\nr -3q +5p = -5 -0 +5 =0, which is correct.\n\nAnd from equation 4: -3r +5q = -3(-5) + 0 =15, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, p=1, q=0, r=-5.\n\nTherefore, the quadratic factor is \\( x^2 +0x -5 =x^2 -5 \\). So, indeed, \\( p(x)=x^2 -5 \\). Therefore, factoring confirms the division result.\n\nAnother method I could consider is using synthetic division or other factoring techniques, but since both polynomial division and factoring lead me to the same result, I\u2019m confident that \\( p(x) =x^2 -5 \\).\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can graph both polynomials and see if their product makes sense, but graphing often isn't necessary if all the algebraic methods confirm the solution.\n\nAlternatively, I can plug in a value for x into both sides and verify.\n\nLet\u2019s pick x=1:\n\nCompute LHS: (1^2 -3*1 +5)*p(1) = (1 -3 +5)*p(1)=3*p(1)\nCompute RHS:1^4 -3*1^3 +15*1 -25 =1 -3 +15 -25= (1-3)= -2, (-2 +15)=13, (13-25)=-12. So RHS value at x=1 is -12.\nThus, 3*p(1)=-12, so p(1)= -4.\n\nNow, p(x)=x^2 -5, so p(1)=1 -5= -4. It matches.\n\nAnother test with x=2:\n\nLHS: (4 -6 +5)*p(2)= (3)*p(2)\nRHS:16 -24 +30 -25= (16-24)= -8, (-8+30)=22, (22-25)= -3. So RHS at x=2 is -3.\nTherefore, 3*p(2)= -3, so p(2)= -1.\n\nCompute p(2)= 4 -5= -1. That checks out.\n\nOne more test with x=0:\n\nLHS: (0 -0 +5)*p(0)=5*p(0)\nRHS:0 -0 +0 -25= -25. So, 5*p(0)= -25, p(0)= -5.\n\nCompute p(0)=0 -5= -5. That also works.\n\nSo, all my test points are satisfied, which adds more confidence that p(x)=x^2 -5 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way is to notice that the given polynomial x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 might be factorable into two quadratics, one of which is x^2 -3x +5, so if I can factor it, that gives me p(x).\n\nBut perhaps an even quicker check is to plug in x= something that makes p(x) zero or something, but maybe not necessary here since the previous thoroughness is sufficient.\n\nThinking through, am I making any incorrect assumptions? The original setup is a product of polynomials and getting the quotient by division, but since both polynomials have integer coefficients, it's likely to be with lesser chance of error. Moreover, synthetic division would be faster if I thought in terms of factoring in (x - a), but in this case, since it's a quadratic, it's a bit more involved.\n\nBut as I already confirmed with factoring by coefficient comparison, it's sufficient. So, I think I'm confident that p(x)=x\u00b2 -5 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, just one thing\u2014when I first thought of polynomial division, I said the process, but then I thought of factoring, so maybe someone might get confused whether the factoring is necessary or not.\n\nBut in this case, since the question is phrased as multiplying p(x) and (x\u00b2 -3x +5), so actually, it's possible to state that p(x) is equal to the division. Thus, either method works.\n\nBut perhaps factoring can be a method in cases when known factors are present. For example, if both the dividend and divisor had some common factor, but in this case, I don't think that's applicable.\n\nAnother thought: maybe sometimes polynomials can have multiple factors or roots, but in this case, since the divisor is quadratic, and having found the other quadratic factor, that's sufficient. And it's another good check that after multiplying the two quadratics, one of them being known, I get back the dividend.\n\nThus, all in all, I think I\u2019ve approached the problem in multiple ways, and all confirm that \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\), we need to perform polynomial division of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n1.

Hmm, okay. Let's see. I guess p(x) must be a polynomial as well, right? Because if I multiply (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) by p(x) and get a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, then p(x) has to be a quadratic (degree 2), since 2 (from x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) plus 2 (from p(x)) equals 4. That makes sense.\n\nSo, let me write p(x) as a general quadratic: p(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c. That seems like a good start because it covers all possibilities for a second-degree polynomial.\n\nNow, the equation given is (x\u00b2 - 3x +5)(ax\u00b2 + bx + c) = x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Okay, so if I multiply these two polynomials together, I should end up with that result. Therefore, I can expand the left-hand side and then set the coefficients equal to those on the right-hand side. Since the coefficients of corresponding powers of x must be equal for the two polynomials to be equal, I can set up equations and solve for a, b, and c.\n\nLet me go ahead and perform that multiplication. I'll multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.\n\nFirst, take x\u00b2 multiplied by each term in p(x):\n\n- x\u00b2 * ax\u00b2 = a x\u2074\n- x\u00b2 * bx = b x\u00b3\n- x\u00b2 * c = c x\u00b2\n\nThen, take -3x multiplied by each term in p(x):\n\n- -3x * ax\u00b2 = -3a x\u00b3\n- -3x * bx = -3b x\u00b2\n- -3x * c = -3c x\n\nNext, take +5 multiplied by each term in p(x):\n\n- 5 * ax\u00b2 = 5a x\u00b2\n- 5 * bx = 5b x\n- 5 * c = 5c\n\nNow, let's combine all those terms:\n\n= a x\u2074\n+ b x\u00b3 + c x\u00b2\n-3a x\u00b3 -3b x\u00b2 -3c x\n+5a x\u00b2 +5b x +5c\n\nNow, let's collect like terms:\n\n- x\u2074 term: a x\u2074\n- x\u00b3 terms: b x\u00b3 - 3a x\u00b3\n- x\u00b2 terms: c x\u00b2 -3b x\u00b2 +5a x\u00b2\n- x terms: -3c x +5b x\n- constant term: 5c\n\nSo, writing it all together:\n\n= a x\u2074 + (b - 3a) x\u00b3 + (c -3b +5a) x\u00b2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c\n\nNow, we know this is equal to x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. So, to find coefficients, let's set the coefficients equal for each power of x:\n\nFor x\u2074: a = 1\n\nFor x\u00b3: (b - 3a) = -3\n\nFor x\u00b2: (c - 3b +5a) = 0 (since there's no x\u00b2 term on the right side)\n\nFor x: (-3c +5b) = 15\n\nFor constant term: 5c = -25\n\nOkay, so that gives us a system of equations:\n\n1. a = 1\n\n2. b - 3a = -3\n\n3. c - 3b +5a = 0\n\n4. -3c +5b = 15\n\n5. 5c = -25\n\nAlright, let's solve these equations step by step starting from the first equation.\n\nEquation 1: a = 1. So, a is 1. That's straightforward.\n\nMoving to Equation 5: 5c = -25; so, divide both sides by 5, c = -25 / 5 = -5. So, c = -5.\n\nNow that we have a=1 and c=-5, let's plug into Equation 2: Equation 2 says b -3a = -3.\n\nSubstituting a=1, we get: b -3(1) = -3 => b -3 = -3 => b = 0\n\nWait, b = 0?\n\nLet me pause. Let me write down all these steps when plugging in:\n\nEquation 2: b -3a = -3\n\nWith a=1: b - 3(1) = -3 => b -3 = -3 => b = -3 +3 => b=0. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo, b=0. Okay, moving to Equation 3: c -3b +5a = 0.\n\nWe know c=-5, b=0, a=1, so:\n\n-5 -3(0) +5(1) = 0 => -5 +0 +5 = 0 => 0=0. Perfect, it holds.\n\nNow, let's move to Equation 4: -3c +5b = 15.\n\nPlug in c=-5, b=0:\n\n-3(-5)+5(0)=15 =>15 +0=15=>15=15. Also holds.\n\nHmm, so all the equations are consistent. So, we have a=1, b=0, c=-5.\n\nTherefore, the quadratic polynomial p(x)= ax\u00b2 +bx +c=1 x\u00b2 +0x -5 => x\u00b2 - 5.\n\nWait a second. Is that it? So, p(x)=x\u00b2 -5? Hmm. Let me verify.\n\nLet me multiply (x\u00b2 -3x +5) by (x\u00b2 -5) and see if I get the given quartic.\n\nSo, let's do that.\n\n(x\u00b2 -3x +5)(x\u00b2 -5). Let's compute term by term.\n\nFirst, x\u00b2 * x\u00b2 =x\u2074\n\nx\u00b2 * (-5)= -5x\u00b2\n\nThen, -3x *x\u00b2= -3x\u00b3\n\n-3x*(-5)=15x\n\nThen, +5* x\u00b2=5x\u00b2\n\n+5*(-5)= -25\n\nSo, combining all those:\n\nx\u2074 -5x\u00b2 -3x\u00b3 +15x +5x\u00b2 -25\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\nx\u2074 (only term)\n\n-3x\u00b3 (only term)\n\nThen, (-5x\u00b2 +5x\u00b2)=0x\u00b2\n\n15x (only term)\n\n-25 (constant term)\n\nSo, total polynomial is x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Which is exactly the given polynomial on the right-hand side.\n\nWow, that's perfect. So, my values of a=1, b=0, c=-5 result in p(x) = x\u00b2 -5, and this works.\n\nSo, therefore, p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\nWait, maybe I should write p(x)=x\u00b2 -5 to make sure it's correct.\n\nBut let me just double-check my multiplication:\n\n(x\u00b2 -3x +5)(x\u00b2 -5) = x\u2074 -5x\u00b2 -3x\u00b3 +15x +5x\u00b2 -25. The x\u00b2 terms cancel out, and the rest gives x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Yes, that's exactly what we needed. So, seems correct.\n\nSo, like I thought, when we had a=1, b=0, c=-5, everything worked out. So, yeah, p(x) is definitely x\u00b2 -5. I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, maybe I can notice if the polynomials could have been factored or had some factors canceled, but (x\u00b2 -3x +5) is not factorable over the reals, as discriminant is 9 -20 = -11 <0, so it can't be factored into real linear terms.\n\nAlso, the right-hand side, x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Let me see, does that factor?

Hmm, alright, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that an even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in its domain, and an odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). That means, for \\( f \\), swapping the sign of the input doesn't change the output, but for \\( g \\), it flips the sign of the output when the input is negated.\n\nNow, the function in question is \\( f(g(x^3)) \\). I need to determine if this is even, odd, or neither. To check that, I should see if \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\) relates to \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) in a way that fits the definitions.\n\nLet me compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\). First, notice that \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\) because raising a negative to an odd power keeps it negative. So, inside the function \\( g \\), we have \\( g(-x^3) \\).\n\nSince \\( g \\) is an odd function, \\( g(-y) = -g(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). Let me substitute \\( y = x^3 \\), so \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).\n\nNow, substitute this back into the original expression: \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n\nSince \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-z) = f(z) \\) for any \\( z \\). Letting \\( z = g(x^3) \\), it follows that \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nPutting this all together, we have \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), which is \\( f(g(x^3)) \\). This means that the function \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\) satisfies \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), because \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n\nTherefore, by definition, \\( h(x) \\) is an even function.\n\nWait, did I skip any steps? Let me check again.\n\n1. Start with \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n2. Compute \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\).\n3. Simplify the inside: \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\), so \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n4. Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\), so \\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n5. Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n6. That is \\( f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n7. So, \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), which means \\( h \\) is even.\n\nYep, that all checks out. So, whether I cube \\( x \\), apply the odd function \\( g \\), which flips the sign, and then apply the even function \\( f \\), which doesn't care about the sign, results in the overall function being even.\n\nI don't think I made a mistake here. It makes sense because the composition essentially neutralizes the effect of the odd function because of the even function wrapping around it. So, the result is symmetric, hence even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1.

So, let's start by recalling some basic definitions to get a grip on this.\n\nAn even function satisfies the condition \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in its domain. On the other hand, an odd function meets the condition \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in its domain. Okay, so that's clear. Now, in this problem, we\u2019re dealing with compositions of functions, which can sometimes be tricky, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me establish what we know:\n\n1. \\( f(x) \\) is an even function. That means \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\).\n2. \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, so \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n3. We need to analyze the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) and determine if it's even, odd, or neither.\n\nAlright, let's tackle the composition step by step. Let me define a new function \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\) to make things clearer. The question is whether \\( h(-x) \\) equals \\( h(x) \\) (even), \\( -h(x) \\) (odd), or something else.\n\nSo, to figure out what kind of function \\( h(x) \\) is, let's compute \\( h(-x) \\) and see how it relates to \\( h(x) \\). Let's do that step by step.\n\nStart with \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\). Let's simplify the inner part first. \\( (-x)^3 \\) is equal to \\( -x^3 \\), right? Since when you raise a negative number to an odd power, it remains negative. So, \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\). Therefore, the expression becomes:\n\n\\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n\nNow, I remember that \\( g(x) \\) is odd, so substituting \\( -x^3 \\) into \\( g \\) should give us \\( -g(x^3) \\). Let's write that down:\n\n\\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for \\( h(-x) \\):\n\n\\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n\nHmm, so we have \\( f(-g(x^3)) \\) now. Here, \\( f(x) \\) is even. What happens when we plug in \\( -g(x^3) \\) into an even function?\n\nSince \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). So, if we let \\( y = g(x^3) \\), then:\n\n\\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nBut wait, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is exactly our original function \\( h(x) \\). So, substituting that back:\n\n\\( h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n\nSo, \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), which per the definitions, means that \\( h(x) \\) is even.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any steps or assumptions. Let's go step by step again.\n\n1. \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n2. To find if \\( h(-x) \\) equals \\( h(x) \\) or \\( -h(x) \\), compute \\( h(-x) \\):\n   - \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n3. Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\):\n   - \\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n4. Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n5. Thus, \\( h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n\nYes, everything checks out. So, each step holds. So, the composition \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\nWait another thought\u2014is the composition of an even and an odd function necessarily even or could it vary? Let's think.\n\nSuppose \\( f \\) is even and \\( g \\) is odd. Then, when you compose them, the inside function is odd (\\( g(x^3) \\). But since \\( x^3 \\) is also an odd function (because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\)), composing an odd function \\( g \\) with another odd function \\( x^3 \\) gives us \\( g(x^3) \\) as odd?\n\nWait, hold on: is \\( g(x^3) \\) even, odd, or neither?\n\nIf \\( g \\) is odd, then \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). So, let's compute \\( g((-x)^3) = g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\), because \\( g \\) is odd. So, \\( g(x^3) \\) is an odd function, because \\( g((-x)^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, the inner function \\( g(x^3) \\) is odd.\n\nSo, now, \\( f \\) maps this intermediate odd function. So, \\( h(x) = f \\) (something odd). Since \\( f \\) is even, how does it interact with an odd input?\n\nLet's note that even functions take care of the sign, so \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\). Therefore, no matter if the input to \\( f \\) is odd or not, \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\). So, even when the input is odd, you still get the same value as when you input the positive version.\n\nSo, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), leading to \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), as established before.\n\nBut hold on, let me consider specific examples to verify my conclusion because sometimes these properties can be counter-intuitive.\n\nSuppose \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\), which is odd. Then, computing \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\), which is \\( (x^3)^2 = x^6 \\). Is \\( x^6 \\) even? Yes, because any even power of \\( x \\) is an even function.\n\nAlternatively, take another even function, say \\( f(x) = \\cos(x) \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = \\sin(x) \\), which is odd. Then, \\( h(x) = \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\). Then, \\( h(-x) = \\cos(\\sin((-x)^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(-x^3)) = \\cos(-\\sin(x^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\), because cosine is an even function. Therefore, \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so it is even as well.\n\nBut wait, let me think if I can get an example where the composition is neither even nor odd. Let me see.\n\nSuppose \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x + x^3 \\). Is \\( g(x) \\) odd? Let's check \\( g(-x) = (-x) + (-x)^3 = -x - x^3 = - (x + x^3) = -g(x) \\), so yes, \\( g \\) is odd.\n\nThen \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) = (g(x^3))^2 = (x^3 + (x^3)^3)^2 = (x^3 + x^9)^2 \\). Let me test \\( h(-x) = (-x^3 + (-x^9))^2 = (-x^3 - x^9)^2 = (x^3 + x^9)^2 = h(x) \\). So, still, it's even. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need a different example where maybe \\( f \\) isn't just a power function. Let me take \\( f(x) = |x| \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\), which is odd. Then, \\( h(x) = |x^3| \\). Now, \\( |(-x)^3| = | -x^3 | = |x^3| \\), so \\( h(-x) = |x^3| = h(x) \\), which is still even.\n\nIs there a scenario where the composition would be odd?\n\nWait, for \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) to be odd, we need \\( f(g(-x^3)) = -f(g(x^3)) \\), but since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), so for the antipodal condition to hold, \\( f(g(-x^3)) = -f(g(x^3)) \\) meaning \\( f(-g(x^3)) = -f(g(x^3)) \\), which would only require that \\( f(-y) = -f(y) \\) for \\( y = g(x^3) \\), but since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\). Therefore, unless \\( f(y) \\) is also odd for all \\( y \\), the equality may not hold. But \\( f \\) is given as even, not odd.\n\nTherefore, in general, unless \\( f \\) is both even and odd, which is only possible if it's the zero function, it's impossible for the composition to be odd because \\( f \\) being even forces \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), making \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), hence even.\n\nTherefore, my earlier conclusion seems solid.\n\nSo, summarizing the steps:\n\n- Start with \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n- Compute \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n- Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).\n- Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n- Therefore, \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so \\( h(x) \\) is even.\n\nI think that checks out. I considered some specific examples, and in each case, the composition came out even. I also stepped through the general case again without seeing any contradictions, which supports my conclusion.\n\nSo, to wrap it up, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is an even function.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) ) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1.

Hmm, okay, let's unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that even functions satisfy \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in their domain. Examples are things like \\( x^2 \\) or cosine functions. On the other hand, odd functions satisfy \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). Examples of odd functions include \\( x^3 \\) or sine functions.\n\nSo, we have \\( f \\) being even, \\( g \\) being odd. The composite function we're looking at is \\( f(g(x^3)) \\). Let me write this out: \\( f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nI need to figure out if this composite function is even, odd, or neither. To do that, I should check the definition of even and odd for composite functions. That is, I should find \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\) and compare it to \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) and see if it equals either \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) or \\( -f(g(x^3)) \\), or neither.\n\nLet's compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\).\n\nFirst, calculate \\( (-x)^3 \\). That's \\( -x^3 \\). So, we have \\( g(-x^3) \\).\n\nBut since \\( g \\) is an odd function, \\( g(-y) = -g(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). Let me substitute \\( y = x^3 \\) here. So, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, \\( f(g(-x^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n\nNow, since \\( f \\) is an even function, \\( f(-z) = f(z) \\) for any \\( z \\). Let me denote \\( z = g(x^3) \\), then \\( f(-z) = f(z) \\).\n\nSo, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). Putting it all together, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). Therefore, the function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) satisfies \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), which is the definition of an even function.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I started by evaluating \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\), which breaks down to \\( f(-g(x^3)) \\) because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\) and \\( g \\) is odd. Then, since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). So the composition is even. Hmm, seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can test it with specific examples to make sure.\n\nLet's take \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) (which is even) and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\) (which is odd). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = (x^3)^2 = x^6 \\). Is \\( x^6 \\) even or odd? Well, substituting \\( -x \\) gives \\( (-x)^6 = x^6 \\), so yes, it's even. So in this case, it's even.\n\nAnother example: Let \\( f(x) = \\cos(x) \\) (which is even) and \\( g(x) = \\sin(x) \\) (which is odd). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\). Let's check if this is even or odd. Compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = \\cos(\\sin((-x)^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(-x^3)) \\). Since \\( \\sin(-x^3) = -\\sin(x^3) \\) (because sine is odd), then \\( \\cos(-\\sin(x^3)) \\). Cosine is an even function, so \\( \\cos(-a) = \\cos(a) \\), so this becomes \\( \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\). Therefore, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), so this composite function is also even. Interesting.\n\nWait, is that always the case, regardless of the specific even and odd functions? Let me test another example. Maybe with \\( f(x) = x^4 \\) (even) and \\( g(x) = x^5 \\) (odd). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = (x^5)^4 = x^{20} \\), which is even because \\( (-x)^{20} = x^{20} \\). Seems okay.\n\nPerhaps an even function that's not just a power, and an odd function that isn't a power. Let's see, \\( f(x) = e^{x^2} \\) (which is even since \\( e^{(-x)^2} = e^{x^2} \\)) and \\( g(x) = \\sin(x) \\) (which is odd). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = e^{(\\sin(x^3))^2} \\). Let's check if this is even: Replace \\( x \\) with \\( -x \\) and see if equality holds.\n\n\\( f(g((-x)^3)) = e^{(\\sin((-x)^3))^2} = e^{(\\sin(-x^3))^2} \\). Since sine is odd, \\( \\sin(-x^3) = -\\sin(x^3) \\). So squaring it, \\( (-\\sin(x^3))^2 = (\\sin(x^3))^2 \\). Therefore, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = e^{(\\sin(x^3))^2} = f(g(x^3)) \\). So again it's even.\n\nHmm, seems that across the board it's even.\n\nAlternatively, let me try if \\( g(x) \\) isn't odd but even, just for testing. Wait, but in this problem, \\( g \\) is odd. So if I wouldn't get the right result? Anyway, in our problem \\( g \\) is odd, so that's consistent.\n\nLet me try another example where \\( f \\) is even, but \\( g \\) is different. Say \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), \\( g(x) = x^3 + x \\), which is odd because \\( g(-x) = -x^3 -x = -(x^3 + x) = -g(x) \\). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = (x^3 + x)^2 = x^6 + 2x^4 + x^2 \\). Test whether this is even: substitute \\( -x \\): \\( (-x)^6 + 2(-x)^4 + (-x)^2 = x^6 + 2x^4 + x^2 \\), which is the same as before. So yes, it's even.\n\nAlternatively, take a non-algebraic even function. Suppose \\( f(x) = |x| \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\), which is odd. Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = |g(x^3)| = |x^9| = |x|^9 \\). Wait, is that even or odd?\n\n\\( |x^9| = |x|^9 \\). Then evaluating at \\( -x \\): \\( |(-x)^9| = | -x^9 | = |x|^9 \\). So they are equal, so \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even again.\n\nWait, so in all these examples, it's even. So is there a reason why? Let's see:\n\n1. Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\n2. Then \\( g(x^3) \\) as is: for any \\( x \\), \\( g(x^3) \\) is... wait, it's not straightforwardly odd or even because \\( x^3 \\) is odd.\n\nWait, but if \\( g \\) is odd, then \\( g(x^3) \\) is still a function, right? Let me check if \\( g(x^3) \\) is even or odd. Let's consider \\( h(x) = g(x^3) \\). Is \\( h(-x) = -h(x) \\) or \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\)?\n\nCompute \\( h(-x) = g((-x)^3) = g(-x^3) \\). But since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). So \\( h(-x) = -g(x^3) = -h(x) \\). Therefore, \\( h(x) = g(x^3) \\) is an odd function.\n\nSo in reality, after the substitution, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) becomes \\( f(h(x)) \\) where \\( h(x) \\) is odd.\n\nNow, since \\( f \\) is even, what happens when we plug an odd function into an even function? Let me recall:\n\nIf \\( h(x) \\) is odd, \\( h(-x) = -h(x) \\). So \\( f(h(-x)) = f(-h(x)) \\). Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-h(x)) = f(h(x)) \\). Therefore, \\( f(h(-x)) = f(h(x)) \\), which means \\( f \\circ h \\) is even, because \\( (f \\circ h)(-x) = (f \\circ h)(x) \\).\n\nTherefore, yes, the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it:\n\nLet me denote \\( y = x^3 \\). Then \\( f(g(y)) \\). Since \\( y = x^3 \\), which has a power of 3. So if I replace \\( x \\) with \\( -x \\), \\( y \\) becomes \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\). So then \\( f(g(-x^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\) because \\( g \\) is odd. And since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). Hence, \\( f(g(x^3)) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\), so the function is even.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the specific even and odd functions chosen, as long as \\( f \\) is even and \\( g \\) is odd, the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) ends up being even.\n\nIs there a situation when this might not hold? Maybe if \\( f \\) or \\( g \\) are not injective or something? Hmm, but the property doesn't depend on injectivity or surjectivity because it's based solely on the functional equations \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) and \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). So since these properties hold for all \\( x \\), regardless of specific behavior, then the composition will always satisfy \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\) making it even.\n\nTherefore, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is an even function.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1. **Properties of Even and Odd Functions**:\n   - An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\).\n   - An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the Composite Function**:\n   - We need to check if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even or odd.\n   - Consider \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\).

I have this math problem here: If f(x) is an even function and g(x) is an odd function, find if f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, odd, or neither. Hmm, I remember that even and odd functions have specific properties, so maybe I can use those to figure it out.\n\nFirst off, let's recall what even and odd functions are. An even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain. So, if I plug in -x, it's the same as plugging in x. Classic examples are functions like f(x) = x\u00b2 or cosine functions.\n\nOn the other hand, an odd function satisfies g(-x) = -g(x). So, flipping the sign of x flips the sign of the output. Examples include g(x) = x\u00b3 or sine functions.\n\nAlright, so in this problem, f is even, g is odd. I need to compute whether the composition f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, odd, or neither. Let me think through the composition step by step.\n\nLet me denote h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)). So, h(x) is the composition of f(g(x\u00b3)). To determine if h(x) is even, odd, or neither, I should check h(-x).\n\nLet me compute h(-x):\n\nh(-x) = f(g((-x)\u00b3)).\n\nFirst, let's process inner function g. Since -x is raised to the 3rd power, (-x)\u00b3 = -x\u00b3. So, the argument becomes -x\u00b3. Then, since g is odd, g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). So, substituting back into h(-x), we have:\n\nh(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n\nNow, since f is even, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)). Let me note that down.\n\nTherefore, h(-x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = h(x). \n\nWait, so h(-x) = h(x). That means h(x) is even because it satisfies the definition of an even function, right? Because plugging in -x doesn't change the value of h(x).\n\nLet me double-check that step:\n\n1. Start with h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n2. To find if it's even or odd, evaluate h(-x).\n3. Compute g(-x\u00b3). Since g is odd, g(-y) = -g(y). So, let y = x\u00b3, then g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3).\n4. Thus, h(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n5. Since f is even, f(-z) = f(z) for any z. Therefore, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n6. Thus, h(-x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = h(x).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, h(-x) = h(x), which is exactly the condition for h(x) being even. Therefore, f(g(x\u00b3)) is an even function.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any steps or misapply the properties. Hmm.\n\nAnother way to think about it: suppose f(x) is even, so f(-y) = f(y). g is odd, so g(-z) = -g(z). So, plugging into h(-x):\n\nh(-x) = f(g((-x)\u00b3)) = f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-g(x\u00b3)) because g is odd. Then, using f is even, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = h(x). So yes, h(-x) = h(x), so h is even.\n\nAlternatively, I can use substitutions:\n\nLet\u2019s consider substituting x with -x in h(x):\n\nh(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(-x^3)) because (-x)^3 is -x^3.\n\nSince g is odd, g(-x^3) = -g(x^3). Plugging that in, h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)).\n\nBut f is even, so f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)).\n\nBut f(g(x^3)) is exactly h(x). So, h(-x) = h(x), so h is even.\n\nTherefore, regardless of specific functions f and g, as long as f is even and g is odd, the composition f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nLet me test with actual functions to verify.\n\nSuppose f(x) = x\u00b2 (which is even) and g(x) = x\u00b3 (which is odd). Then h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = (x\u00b3)^3 = x^9.\n\nWait, is x^9 even or odd? Well, x^9 is an odd function because (-x)^9 = -x^9. So, wait, h(x) = x^9 is odd, which contradicts our earlier conclusion that it's even.\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem right. Did I make an error somewhere?\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me compute h(x) in this case.\n\nf(x) = x\u00b2, g(x) = x\u00b3.\n\nThen h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = f((x\u00b3)^3) = f(x^9) = (x^9)^2 = x^18.\n\nAh, that's even because (-x)^18 = x^18. So h(-x) = (-x)^18 = x^18 = h(x). So, in this case, h(x) is even.\n\nBut earlier, I thought h(x) = x^9, which is odd, but actually, wait, no:\n\nNo, because in the composition f(g(x\u00b3)), with f(x) = x\u00b2, which is even, and g(x\u00b3) is x^9, which is an odd function. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) is (x^9)\u00b2 = x^{18}. So, yes, it's even.\n\nWait, but if I had g(x) = x\u00b3, f(x) = x, then h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = x\u00b3, which is odd. Hmm, but in that case, f is neither even nor odd necessarily? Wait, no.\n\nWait, is f(x) = x considered even or odd? f(-x) = -x = -f(x), so yes, f(x) = x is odd. So in that example, f is odd, right.\n\nBut in our original problem, f is even. So, in my first example, with f being x\u00b2 and g being x\u00b3: f is even, g is odd. So then, h is f(g(x\u00b3)) is x^18, which is even. So that works.\n\nBut wait, if f is the identity function, which is odd, and g is odd, then f(g(x\u00b3)) would be g(x\u00b3), which, if g is odd, would make it odd cubed, which is also odd. So, we can clearly see that the composition's parity depends on the functions involved.\n\nWait, but in our problem, f is even, g is odd.\n\nWait, let me take another example to check.\n\nSuppose f(x) = x^4, which is even. g(x) = x^5, which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) would be (x^5)^3)^4? Wait, no. Wait, no, wait, g(x\u00b3) is x\u00b3^5? Wait, no: Hold on, no. If g(x) = x^5, then g(x\u00b3) = (x\u00b3)^5 = x^{15}.\n\nThen, f(g(x\u00b3)) = f(x^{15}) = (x^{15})^4 = x^{60}. Which is even, because (-x)^60 = x^60. So yes, h(x) = x^{60} is even.\n\nAlternatively, if I took g(x) = x (odd) and f(x) = x\u00b2 (even). Then f(g(x\u00b3)) is (g(x\u00b3))^2 = (x\u00b3)^2 = x^6, which is even. So that works too.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake before when thinking of f(x) = x being odd, but in the problem, f is specifically even. So, in that case, if I have f(x) = x, which is odd, but in our problem, f is even, so we have to use f preserving the symmetry, making the composition even.\n\nAlternatively, what if f is a constant function? Like f(x) = 2, which is even? Wait, f(-x) = 2 = f(x), so yes, constant function is even. Then g(x) is odd, say g(x) = x\u00b3. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) = f(x^9) = 2, which is even because h(-x) = 2 = h(x). So yeah, that still holds.\n\nOkay, so testing multiple cases, and in all of them, f(g(x\u00b3)) is even when f is even and g is odd. So, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, I think the conclusion is that h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) is even under the given conditions.\n\nWait, but just to ensure, what if f is even, g is odd, but, say, f is even like x\u00b2, and g is odd like x, so f(g(x\u00b3)) = (x\u00b3)^2 = x^6, which is even. Alternatively, if g was an odd function but not x\u00b3, say, sin(x). Then f(g(x\u00b3)) = (sin(x\u00b3))\u00b2, which is still even because [sin(-x\u00b3)]\u00b2 = [ - sin(x\u00b3) ]\u00b2 = [sin(x\u00b3)]\u00b2, which is equal to (sin(x\u00b3))\u00b2. So, yeah, squaring it would make it even regardless. That also makes sense because f is even, so whatever comes out of g is squared.\n\nSo, seems solid.\n\nAnother angle: If f is even, then f(-y) = f(y). So, for h(x), h(-x) = f(g(-x\u00b3)).\n\nSince g is odd, g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3).\n\nTherefore:\n\nh(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n\nBecause f is even, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nWhich is h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nTherefore, h(-x) = h(x), which is the definition of even.\n\nYep, so that's consistent.\n\nSo, mathematically, no mistake in the reasoning.\n\nPerhaps my initial confusion came when choosing a function g for h(x) = g(x\u00b3), but when f is not necessarily even, but f is applied to g(x\u00b3), then the behavior is different. But in our problem, f is even, so f(g(x\u00b3)) ends up being even.\n\nHence, I feel confident the answer is even.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\nFirst, recall the definitions:\n- An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n- An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\nTo determine the nature of \\( f(g(x^3)) \\), we evaluate it at \\( -x \\):\n\n1.

Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\):\n   \\[\n   h(-x) = f(-g(x^3))\n   \\]\n4. Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\):\n   \\[\n   h(-x) = f(g(x^3))\n   \\]\n5. Recognize that \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is the original function \\( h(x) \\):\n   \\[\n   h(-x) = h(x)\n   \\]\n\nThus, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) satisfies the condition for being an even function. Therefore, the function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>",
        "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c><\uff5cUser\uff5c>Please solve the following mathematical problem, placing your final answer within \\boxed{}:\nIf $f(x)$ is an even function and $g(x)$ is an odd function, find if $f(g(x^3))$ is even, odd, or neither.\n\nEnter \"odd\", \"even\", or \"neither\".<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out if the function f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, odd, or neither. Hmm. Let's see. First, I remember that an even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x, and an odd function satisfies f(-x) = -f(x) for all x.\n\nWait, in this case, f(x) is even and g(x) is odd. So I need to see what happens when I compose these functions with x\u00b3 inside. Let me think step by step.\n\nLet me denote h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)). To determine if h(x) is even, odd, or neither, I should check h(-x) and see how it relates to h(x).\n\nSo, h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)). Let me compute (-x)^3 first. Since (-x)^3 = -x\u00b3, that simplifies to -x\u00b3. So h(-x) becomes f(g(-x\u00b3)).\n\nBut since g is an odd function, g(-y) = -g(y) for any y. Let me let y = x\u00b3, then g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). So substituting back, we have h(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n\nNow, f is an even function, so f(-z) = f(z) for any z. Let me set z = g(x\u00b3), so f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)). Therefore, h(-x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = h(x).\n\nSince h(-x) = h(x), that means h(x) is an even function. So f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nWait, let me go over that again to make sure I didn't skip a step. So f is even, so applying f to something negative is the same as applying f to the positive version. Therefore, h(-x) becomes f of g(-x\u00b3) which is f(g(-x\u00b3)). Since g is odd, g(-x\u00b3) is -g(x\u00b3). So h(-x) becomes f(-g(x\u00b3)). Since f is even, that's the same as f(g(x\u00b3)) which is h(x). So yes, h(-x) = h(x). Therefore, h(x) is even.\n\nHmm, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. Let me double-check with an example maybe? Maybe pick specific f and g functions and test.\n\nSuppose f(x) = x\u00b2, which is even. Let g(x) = x\u00b3 - x, which is an odd function since g(-x) = (-x)^3 - (-x) = -x\u00b3 + x = -(x\u00b3 - x) = -g(x). So f(g(x\u00b3)) would be (g(x\u00b3))\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute g(x\u00b3): g(x\u00b3) = (x\u00b3)^3 - x\u00b3 = x^9 - x\u00b3. Then h(x) = (x^9 - x\u00b3)^2. Let's see what h(-x) is: h(-x) = ((-x)^9 - (-x)^3)^2 = (-x^9 + x^3)^2 = (x^3 - x^9)^2, which is the same as (x^9 - x^3)^2. So h(-x) = h(x). Yep, so that's even.\n\nAnother example: Let\u2019s pick f(x) = cos(x), which is even, and g(x) = sin(x), which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) is cos(sin(x\u00b3)). Now, let's check if this is even. \n\nh(-x) = cos(sin((-x)^3)) = cos(sin(-x\u00b3)) = cos(-sin(x\u00b3)) because sin is odd. But cos is even, so cos(-sin(x\u00b3)) = cos(sin(x\u00b3)) = h(x). So again, h(-x) = h(x). Therefore, even.\n\nWait, what if f is even but g is not necessarily linear? Let's try another one. Let f(x) = e^x + e^{-x}, which is also even. Because f(-x) = e^{-x} + e^{x} = f(x). Let\u2019s let g(x) = x^3, which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) = e^{g(x\u00b3)} + e^{-g(x\u00b3)} = e^{x^9} + e^{-x^9}. Now test h(-x). h(-x) = e^{(-x)^9} + e^{-(-x)^9} = e^{-x^9} + e^{x^9}, which is the same as h(x). So still even.\n\nWait, let me try with an f that's even, and g that's odd but not linear. Let\u2019s take f(x) = |x|, since it's even. Let g(x) be any odd function, say, g(x) = x^5 - x, which is odd.\n\nThen f(g(x\u00b3)) is |g(x\u00b3)| = |x^15 - x\u00b3|. Now, let's find h(-x) = |g((-x)^3)| = |g(-x\u00b3)| = | -g(x\u00b3) | = | - (x^15 - x\u00b3) | = |x^15 - x\u00b3| because absolute value of negative is positive. So again, h(-x) = h(x). Even.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Let me think if there's a case where it's not even.\n\nWait, suppose f is even, say f(x) = x^4 which is even, and g(x) = x^3 - x^5, which is still odd. Hmm, then g(x\u00b3) is (x\u00b3)^3 - (x\u00b3)^5 = x^9 - x^{15}, so h(x) = (x^9 - x^{15})^4. Then h(-x) = ((-x)^9 - (-x)^{15})^4. But since -x^9 = -x^9 and -x^{15} = -x^{15}. So (-x^9 - (-x^{15})) = -x^9 + x^{15}. Then h(-x) is (-x^9 + x^{15})^4.\n\nBut (-x^9 + x^{15}) is equal to -(x^9 - x^{15}), and raising it to the 4th power: (-1)^4*(x^9 - x^{15})^4 = (x^9 - x^{15})^4, same as h(x). So h(-x)=h(x). Thus even.\n\nAnother scenario: suppose f is even, g is odd, so f(g(x\u00b3)). So plugging in -x into x\u00b3 gives -x\u00b3, which, because g is odd, gives -g(x\u00b3). And since f is even, f(-g(x\u00b3))=f(g(x\u00b3))=h(x). So algebraically, yes, it's even. \n\nWait, is there any case where this wouldn't hold? Maybe if the functions are more complicated? Suppose f is even, g is odd, and f(g(x\u00b3)) is a constant function, which is also even or odd? Wait, let's say f is the constant function. Suppose f(x)=1, which is even. Let g(x)=x, which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3))=1, which is even. So in that case, it's even. Alternatively, f(x)=0 is even, g(x)=0, which is even\u2014wait, is zero function considered both even and odd? Wait, actually, the zero function is both even and odd since f(-x)=f(x) and f(-x)=-f(x). So in that trivial case, it's both.\n\nBut regardless, if h(x) is both even and odd, it's actually the zero function. But in the above problem, f is even, g is odd, so f(g(x\u00b3)) would have to be... Wait, except for the zero function, other cases?\n\nWait, if g(x\u00b3) is such that g(x\u00b3) is a constant function? Hmm, like if g(x) is a constant. Let me say g(x)=k, which is a constant. Then since g is a constant, which is also even because g(-x)=k=-k? No, wait, g(x)=k implies that it's even if k= -k, which implies k=0. So if g is a constant function, it's a constant zero function, because otherwise, if it's a non-zero constant, g(-x)=g(x) as it's a constant, but for oddity, g(-x)=-g(x), which would require k = -k, meaning k must be zero.\n\nSo in that case, if g was a constant non-zero, it can't be odd. So g must be zero function. Then f(g(x\u00b3))=f(0). If f is even, f(0) is a constant. So the result is a constant, which as I said, is both even and odd.\n\nBut in that case, is that different from just being even? Well, if it is a constant function, it's both. So, in terms of whether it's considered even or just even? Since only even and odd functions are usually defined up to sign, but as per problem statement, we can say it's even because it satisfies the condition without violating being odd. Wait, but if a function is both even and odd, it's the zero function. So if f(x)=0, then h(x)=0 is both, but in this case, if g(x)=0, then h(x)=f(0), which is a constant. So if f(0) is non-zero, h(x)=c, which is both even and odd only if c=0.\n\nBut in any case, regardless of that specific case, since in the earlier steps we showed that h(-x)=h(x), which is sufficient for being even. It might also be odd if h(x)=0, but in that case, only the zero function is both. Otherwise, h(x) would just be even.\n\nSo, when dealing with h(x)=f(g(x\u00b3)), since g is odd, the composition flips the sign, but f, being even, negates it back, leading h(x) to be even. Alternatively, all the steps algebraically lead to h(-x)=h(x). So I think it's safe to conclude that f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nI think my thought process is solid here. So, the answer must be even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nTo determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither, we start by noting that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function. \n\nA function \\( h(x) \\) is even if \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\) for all \\( x \\), and it is odd if \\( h(-x) = -h(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\nLet \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).

It tells me that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function. Hmm, okay, let me recall some properties of even and odd functions.\n\nAn even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\), right? So, if I plug in \\(-x\\), it's the same as plugging in \\( x \\). Classic examples are like \\( x^2 \\) or cosine functions. On the other hand, an odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). These functions are symmetric about the origin. Examples include \\( x^3 \\) or sine functions.\n\nSo, the problem is about composing functions here: \\( f(g(x^3)) \\). Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that \\( x^3 \\) is an odd function because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\). So, \\( g(x^3) \\) would be \\( g(\\text{something odd}) \\). But wait, \\( g \\) is an odd function, so does that mean \\( g(x^3) \\) is odd?\n\nLet me test it: if I plug in \\(-x\\) into \\( g(x^3) \\), it becomes \\( g((-x)^3) = g(-x^3) \\). Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, \\( g(x^3) \\) is indeed an odd function because \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).\n\nSo, now we have \\( g(x^3) \\) as an odd function. The next step is applying \\( f \\) to it. \\( f \\) is even, so \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). Let me set \\( y = g(x^3) \\). Then, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\) because \\( f \\) is even.\n\nNow, to check if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even or odd, I need to evaluate it at \\( -x \\) and see what happens. Let's compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\).\n\nFirst, \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\), so inside the function, we have \\( g(-x^3) \\). But as established earlier, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n\nSince \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). So, replacing \\( x \\) with \\( -x \\) in \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) doesn't change the value; that is, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). \n\nBy the definition of even functions, if \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), then \\( h(x) \\) is even. So here, \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\), and plugging in \\( -x \\) doesn't change the value. That suggests that \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is indeed an even function.\n\nWait, let me make sure there are no mistakes here. What if the composition is more complex? Hmm, let's try a concrete example.\n\nSuppose \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\), which is odd. Then, \\( f(g(x^3)) = (x^3)^2 = x^6 \\). Now, is \\( x^6 \\) even? Yes, because \\( (-x)^6 = x^6 \\). That works.\n\nLet me try another example. Let \\( f(x) = \\cos(x) \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = \\sin(x) \\), which is odd. Then, \\( g(x^3) = \\sin(x^3) \\). Applying \\( f \\), we get \\( \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\). Hmmm, is this function even or odd?\n\nLet's test \\( \\cos(\\sin((-x)^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(-x^3)) \\). Since sine is odd, \\( \\sin(-x^3) = -\\sin(x^3) \\), so \\( \\cos(-\\sin(x^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\) because cosine is even. So, indeed, the composition remains the same when replacing \\( x \\) with \\( -x \\), which means it's even. That seems to back up my earlier conclusion.\n\nIs there a case where it might not be even? Suppose \\( f \\) is a constant function, which is trivially even. Then \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is just a constant, which is even. If \\( f \\) is something else, like \\( f(x) = |x| \\), which is also even, then composing with any odd function inside would still give an even function because \\( |g(x^3)| \\) is the same as \\( |g(-x^3)| \\) since both \\( x^3 \\) and \\( -x^3 \\) are mapped to their absolute values by \\( f \\).\n\nSo, it seems consistent. Each example I test is confirming that the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even when \\( f \\) is even and \\( g \\) is odd. I don't see a scenario where it could be odd. Since both functions have specific symmetries, the result inherits the symmetry from \\( f \\).\n\nWait, but why does it not become odd? Suppose \\( f \\) was odd instead, but in our case, it's even. So, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is made by an even function composed with an odd function inside another odd function. That seems like it would preserve some symmetry but not necessarily switch it.\n\nWait, perhaps another angle: if \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\), and then \\( f(g(-x)) = f(-g(x)) \\). But since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x)) = f(g(x)) \\). So, \\( f(g(-x)) = f(g(x)) \\), which means \\( f(g(x)) \\) is even.\n\nTherefore, in our case, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even because \\( f(g(-x^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nYes, that seems to solidify the conclusion. So, applying \\( f \\) after an odd function preserves the evenness because of how even functions treat negatives inside.\n\nSo, to recap, since \\( g(x^3) \\) is odd, when you apply an even function \\( f \\) to it, the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) becomes even. Therefore, the answer should be that \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is an even function.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1. An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n2. An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n3. The function \\( x^3 \\) is an odd function because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\).\n\nFirst, we evaluate \\( g(x^3) \\):\n- Since \\( g \\) is an odd function, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, \\( g(x^3) \\) is an odd function.\n\nNext, we apply the even function \\( f \\) to \\( g(x^3) \\):\n- Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). Let \\( y = g(x^3) \\). Then, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nTo check if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, we evaluate it at \\( -x \\):\n- \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n- Since \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\), we have \\( f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n- Because \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nThus, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even because it satisfies the condition \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nThe function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>",
        "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c><\uff5cUser\uff5c>Please solve the following mathematical problem, placing your final answer within \\boxed{}:\nIf $f(x)$ is an even function and $g(x)$ is an odd function, find if $f(g(x^3))$ is even, odd, or neither.\n\nEnter \"odd\", \"even\", or \"neither\".<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, we have two functions here: f(x) is even, and g(x) is odd. The question is asking about the nature of another function, f(g(x\u00b3)). Is it even, odd, or neither?\n\nOkay, let me recall my function properties. Even functions satisfy the condition f(-x) = f(x), right? So, for example, f(x) = x\u00b2 is even because (-x)\u00b2 = x\u00b2. On the other hand, odd functions satisfy g(-x) = -g(x), like g(x) = x\u00b3 because (-x)\u00b3 = -x\u00b3.\n\nSo, we're dealing with f(g(x\u00b3)). Let me break this down step by step. First, I can think of the operations as a composition of functions. So, starting from the innermost function, we have x\u00b3, then we apply g to that, and finally f to the result.\n\nGiven that, let's try to test whether f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, odd, or neither. The standard method is to compute f(g((-x)\u00b3)) and see how it relates to f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n1. Compute (-x)\u00b3: that's -x\u00b3. Okay, that negative sign is important.\n2. Then apply g to that result: g(-x\u00b3). But since g is an odd function, g(-a) = -g(a) for any a. So, g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3).\n3. Now, we plug that into f: f(-g(x\u00b3)). So, we have f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n\nBut wait, f is an even function. Even functions satisfy f(-y) = f(y) for any y. So, if we let y = g(x\u00b3), then f(-y) = f(y). Therefore, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nPutting it all together: f(g((-x)\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)). \n\nThis means that when we substitute -x into the function f(g(x\u00b3)), we just get the same value as f(g(x\u00b3)). Which by definition of even functions is exactly what even means.\n\nSo, it seems that f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nBut hold on, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It often helps to test with specific examples for f and g that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nLet's choose f(x) as an even function. The simplest example is f(x) = x\u00b2.\n\nLet's pick g(x) as an odd function. Again, the simplest example is g(x) = x\u00b3.\n\nNow, let's compute f(g(x\u00b3)). Let's see:\n\n- First, compute x\u00b3. Then, apply g to that: g(x\u00b3) = (x\u00b3)\u00b3 = x\u2079.\n- Then, apply f to x\u2079: f(x\u2079) = (x\u2079)\u00b2 = x\u00b9\u2078.\n\nSo, f(g(x\u00b3)) = x\u00b9\u2078.\n\nNow, is x\u00b9\u2078 an even function? Well, yes, because if we replace x with -x, we have (-x)\u00b9\u2078 = x\u00b9\u2078, which is the same as the original function.\n\nSo, in this specific example, f(g(x\u00b3)) is indeed an even function.\n\nLet me try another example to make sure my reasoning isn't flawed.\n\nLet me choose a different even function, say f(x) = cos(x), which is even since cos(-x) = cos(x).\n\nAnd another odd function, say g(x) = x.\n\nSo, f(g(x\u00b3)) becomes f(x\u00b3) = cos(x\u00b3).\n\nIs cos(x\u00b3) even? Yes, because cos(-x\u00b3)=cos(x\u00b3). So, it maintains the evenness.\n\nAnother example: f(x) = |x|, which is even, and g(x) = sin(x), which is odd.\n\nThen, f(g(x\u00b3)) = |g(x\u00b3)| = |sin(x\u00b3)|. Is this even? Let's see: |sin(-x\u00b3)| = | - sin(x\u00b3) | = |sin(x\u00b3)|, so yes, it is even.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Maybe I should try a non-monotonic example.\n\nLet\u2019s take f(x) = x\u00b2 + 1, which is still even, and g(x) = x\u00b3 - x, which is odd because g(-x) = (-x)\u00b3 - (-x) = -x\u00b3 + x = - (x\u00b3 - x) = -g(x).\n\nThen, f(g(x\u00b3)) would be [g(x\u00b3)]\u00b2 + 1 = [ (x\u00b3)\u00b3 - (x\u00b3) ]\u00b2 + 1 = (x\u2079 - x\u00b3)\u00b2 + 1.\n\nExpanding this, we get (x\u00b9\u2078 - 2x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u2076) + 1. Is this even? Yes, since all the exponents are even numbers. So replacing x with -x would yield the same result: [ (-x)\u2079 - (-x)\u00b3 ]\u00b2 + 1 = (-x\u2079 + x\u00b3)\u00b2 + 1 = (x\u2079 - x\u00b3)\u00b2 + 1, which is the same as the original.\n\nSo, again, it's even. Hmm, interesting. Maybe this is a consistent result.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me try a function where perhaps f(g(x\u00b3)) could have different behavior.\n\nSuppose f(x) is even, but not as straightforward, like f(x) = e^(-x\u00b2), which is even since it's symmetric around the y-axis. And then g(x) is odd, say g(x) = x. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) = e^(-x\u2076). Which is still even because exponentials of even powers remain even.\n\nHold on, let me see if I can manage a contrived example where f(g(x\u00b3)) isn't even. Maybe f(x) is even, but somehow g doesn't preserve the signature. But given that g is odd, g(-x) = -g(x), which would inherently create symmetry that when squared or composed within f, which is even, might nullify any asymmetry.\n\nThinking in terms of composition, if you have an even function applied on an odd function, then inside you have an odd function, then applied to an even function, overall what is the result? Wait, perhaps we can think about it as f(g(x)).\n\nBut in our case, it's f(g(x\u00b3)). So, perhaps let\u2019s dissect that:\n\nFirst, x\u00b3 is an odd function, because if you flip x to -x, it becomes -x\u00b3. Then, applying g, which is itself an odd function, so g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). Then, applying f, which is even, so f(-g(x\u00b3))=f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nSo, in other words, f(g(-x\u00b3))=f(g(x\u00b3)) which is exactly the condition for f(g(x\u00b3)) being even.\n\nTherefore, it does hold.\n\nThus, yes, f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nI think that seems consistent across multiple examples. So, I can conclude that f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1. **Understanding the properties**:\n   - An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\).\n   - An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\n2. **Testing the composition**:\n   - Compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\).\n   - Simplify \\( (-x)^3 \\) to \\( -x^3 \\).\n   - Apply \\( g \\) to \\( -x^3 \\).

Let me recall some definitions first. An even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain, and an odd function satisfies f(-x) = -f(x) for all x. \n\nGiven that f(x) is even, so f(-y) = f(y) for any y. And g(x) is odd, so g(-y) = -g(y). Now, I need to determine the nature of the composite function f(g(x^3)). \n\nFirst, maybe I should express f(g(x^3)) in terms of x and then evaluate it at -x to see how it behaves. Let me denote h(x) = f(g(x^3)), so h(-x) will be f(g((-x)^3)). Hmm, since (-x)^3 is equal to -x^3, this simplifies to h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)). \n\nBut wait, g is an odd function, so g(-y) = -g(y). Let me substitute y with x^3 in this equation, so g(-x^3) = -g(x^3). Therefore, h(-x) becomes f(-g(x^3)). \n\nNow, f is an even function, so f(-z) = f(z) for any z. Let me let z = g(x^3), so f(-g(x^3)) becomes f(g(x^3)). Therefore, h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) which is exactly h(x). \n\nSo that means h(-x) = h(x), which is the definition of an even function. So, f(g(x^3)) is an even function. Let me just go through that step by step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n1. Start with h(x) = f(g(x^3)).\n2. Compute h(-x): f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(-x^3)).\n3. Since g is odd, g(-x^3) = -g(x^3).\n4. So, h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)).\n5. Since f is even, f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)).\n6. And that is h(x).\n7. Hence, h(-x) = h(x), so h(x) is even.\n\nYeah, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in that reasoning. So, f(g(x^3)) should be even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine whether the function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1. Start with the function \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n2. Evaluate \\( h(-x) \\): \n   \\[\n   h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3))\n   \\]\n3. Simplify the argument inside \\( g \\):\n   \\[\n   (-x)^3 = -x^3\n   \\]\n   Thus,\n   \\[\n   h(-x) = f(g(-x^3))\n   \\]\n4. Since \\( g(x) \\) is odd, we have \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore,\n   \\[\n   h(-x) = f(-g(x^3))\n   \\]\n5. Since \\( f(x) \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). Hence,\n   \\[\n   h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x)\n   \\]\n6. This shows that \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), which means \\( h(x) \\) is an even function.\n\nThus, the function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>",

They told me that f(x) is even and g(x) is odd. Hmm, okay, let me recall what even and odd functions are.\n\nAn even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain. So, if I plug in -x, I get the same result as when I plug in x. Classic examples are functions like x\u00b2 or cos(x).\n\nAn odd function, on the other hand, satisfies g(-x) = -g(x). So, flipping the sign of x flips the sign of the output. Examples are x\u00b3, sin(x), etc.\n\nAlright, so we have to figure out the nature of f(g(x\u00b3)). Let\u2019s break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe I should figure out what happens when I plug in -x into f(g(x\u00b3)). If f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, then f(g(-x\u00b3)) should equal f(g(x\u00b3)). If it's odd, then f(g(-x\u00b3)) should equal -f(g(x\u00b3)). Otherwise, it would be neither.\n\nSo, let's compute f(g(-x\u00b3)).\n\nSince g is an odd function, g(-x\u00b3) should be equal to -g(x\u00b3). Okay, so:\n\nf(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-g(x\u00b3))\n\nNow, f is an even function, so f(-y) = f(y) for any y. Therefore, replacing y with g(x\u00b3):\n\nf(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3))\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nf(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3))\n\nWhich means f(g(x\u00b3)) satisfies f(-x) = f(x), right? Because replacing x with -x gives the same value.\n\nWait a second, does that make f(g(x\u00b3)) an even function?\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn\u2019t skip a step.\n\nWe had f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-g(x\u00b3)). Since f is even, -g(x\u00b3) inside f is the same as g(x\u00b3), so f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nTherefore, f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)), meaning f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nWait, is there another perspective? Maybe thinking about the composition of functions and their symmetries.\n\nLet me consider the composition f(g(x\u00b3)). The inside function is x\u00b3, which is odd because (-x)\u00b3 = -x\u00b3. So, the inside function is odd.\n\nThen, the outside function is f, which is even. So, f of an odd function? But how does that affect the composition?\n\nIf I recall, composing an even function around an odd function, what does that do? Hmm. Let me think about transformations.\n\nIf you have an even function, say f, and you plug another function h(x) into it. Then, f(h(-x)) = f(-h(x)) because h is odd. But since f is even, f(-h(x)) = f(h(x)). So, f(h(-x)) = f(h(x)).\n\nWhich means f(h(x)) is even.\n\nIn our problem, h(x) is x\u00b3, which is odd. Therefore, f(g(x\u00b3)) as a composition of an even function f around an odd function g(x\u00b3) is even.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, is x\u00b3 an odd function? Yes, because (-x)^3 = -x\u00b3.\n\nThen, g being odd, so plugging that in, I have g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). Then, plugging that into f, which is even, so f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nThat gives us f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)), so f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nLet me try testing it with specific functions to see if this makes sense.\n\nSuppose g(x) = x, which is definitely odd, and f(x) = x\u00b2, which is even. So, f(g(x\u00b3)) = (x\u00b3)\u00b2 = x^6. Is x^6 even? Yes, because (-x)^6 = x^6.\n\nAnother example: Let g(x) = x\u00b3 (which is odd), and f(x) = x^4 (even). Then, f(g(x)) = (x\u00b3)^4 = x^{12}, which is even.\n\nWait, maybe an example where g(x) is some other odd function, like g(x) = sin(x). Let f(x) = x\u00b2 (even). Then, f(g(x^3)) = (sin(x\u00b3))^2. Is that even?\n\nYes, because (sin((-x)^3))^2 = (sin(-x\u00b3))^2 = (-sin(x\u00b3))^2 = (sin(x\u00b3))^2. So, it's even.\n\nAnother test case: let g(x) = -x, which is odd, because g(-x) = -(-x) = x = -g(x). Wait, really? No, actually, g(-x) = -(-x) = x = -g(x) if g(x) = -x. Wait, plugging in x, g(x) = -x, so g(-x) = -(-x) = x, which is -g(x). So, it is odd. So, putting into f(x) = x^3, which is odd, but f needs to be even. So, f(g(x^3)) = (g(x^3))^3 = ( -x^9 )^3 = -x^{27}, which is odd. Wait, hold on, but f is supposed to be even. Wait, let me redo that.\n\nHold on, if f is even, so f(x) = |x| for example. Then, f(g(x\u00b3)) = |g(x\u00b3)|. Since g is odd, g(x\u00b3) is odd, so |g(x\u00b3)| is even, right? Because absolute value makes all negatives positive.\n\nWait, actually, if g(x) is odd, then g(x^3) is odd because x\u00b3 is odd so composing it with g (odd) gives odd, as substitution. So |g(x\u00b3)| is even because the absolute value wraps it, so flipping the sign doesn't matter. Therefore, even.\n\nBut maybe if f is x^2, which is even, f(g(x\u00b3)) = [g(x\u00b3)]\u00b2, which is [(-x\u00b3)]\u00b2 = x^6, which is even.\n\nWait, but if f is an even function and g is odd, f(g(x\u00b3)) is going to be f of something that is odd, but f is even, so f(-y) = f(y). Therefore, f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nWait, yeah, as in the first step. So, f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nThese test cases are showing it's even, so my conclusion seems right.\n\nWait, let me see one more test case where f and g might be more complicated. Suppose f(x) = |x| + x\u00b2, which is even, and g(x) = x, which is odd. Then, f(g(x\u00b3)) = |x\u00b3| + (x\u00b3)\u00b2 = |x\u00b3| + x^6, which is even because absolute value is even and x^6 is even. So, sum is even.\n\nAnother example: f(x) = e^{x} + e^{-x}, which is even, since substituting -x gives e^{-x} + e^{x} which is the same. If g(x) is any odd function, say, g(x) = x. Then, f(g(x\u00b3)) = e^{x\u00b3} + e^{-x\u00b3}, which is even.\n\nWait, is that even? Because if I put -x, I get e^{-x\u00b3} + e^{x\u00b3}, which is the same as before. So yes, even yes.\n\nWait, another odd function for g: g(x) = x^3, so that's an odd function, plug into an even f(x). If f(x) = x^4, then f(g(x\u00b3)) is (x^3)^4 = x^{12}, which is even. If f(x) is |x|, then f(g(x\u00b3)) = |x^3| = |x| x^2, which is even.\n\nSo, all my test cases are giving me that f(g(x\u00b3)) is even. Therefore, I think it's safe to conclude it's even.\n\nWait, what would happen if g were even? Then, g(-x) = g(x), so f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)), and if f is even as well, then f(g(x\u00b3)) would still be even. But in this case, g is odd, so that composition flips to f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)), so the same function.\n\nSo, yeah, seems that as long as f is even and g is odd, then f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to think in terms of composition properties. So, f(g(x\u00b3)) is a composition where the innermost function is x\u00b3 which is odd, composing with g, which is odd, so the result is still odd if you consider g(x\u00b3). Then, f is even, so function f applied to an odd function.\n\nBut when you apply an even function on an odd function, do you get even or odd? So, if h(x) is odd, then f(h(x)) where f is even. Then, f(h(-x)) = f(-h(x)) = f(h(x)). So, f(h(-x)) = f(h(x)), which means f(h(x)) is even.\n\nHence f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nSo, that seems to fit.\n\nAlternatively, because x\u00b3 is odd, the composition inside is g(x\u00b3), which is odd, then f is even, so the outer function is even, so when you apply it to an odd function, you get an even function.\n\nHence, all of these lines of thought lead me to the conclusion that it's even. Therefore, the answer should be even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nTo determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither, we start by recalling the properties of even and odd functions.

I need to determine whether the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\nFirst, let me recall some definitions. An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in its domain. On the other hand, an odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). Now, I need to analyze the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nLet me break it down step by step. The composition involves three functions: first, \\( x^3 \\), then \\( g \\), and finally \\( f \\). So, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is a composition of these three functions.\n\nSince \\( x^3 \\) is a function, let's think about whether it's even or odd. Remember, \\( (x)^3 \\) is an odd function because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\). So, the innermost function \\( x^3 \\) is odd.\n\nNext, \\( g(x) \\) is given as an odd function, so if I apply \\( g \\) to \\( x^3 \\), which is odd, how does that affect the result? Let me compute \\( g(x^3) \\). If \\( g \\) is odd, then \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). But since we're dealing with \\( g \\) applied to \\( x^3 \\), maybe it's helpful to consider substituting \\( -x \\) into \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) and see what happens.\n\nSo, let's define \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\). To check if \\( h(x) \\) is even or odd, I'll compute \\( h(-x) \\) and compare it to \\( h(x) \\) and \\( -h(x) \\).\n\nComputing \\( h(-x) \\):\n\n\\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\)  \nSimplify \\( (-x)^3 \\).  \n\\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\), so  \n\\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n\nNow, since \\( g \\) is an odd function, \\( g(-y) = -g(y) \\) for any y. Let me set \\( y = x^3 \\), so:\n\n\\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).  \nTherefore,  \n\\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).  \nBut \\( f \\) is an even function. Applying an even function to \\( -g(x^3) \\) gives:  \n\\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), because \\( f(-a) = f(a) \\) when \\( f \\) is even.\n\nSo, \\( h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( h(x) \\) satisfies the condition for being an even function: \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\). Hence, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\nWait, let me go through that again to make sure I haven't missed anything. Starting with \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\). \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\) because \\( g \\) is odd. Then, passing this through \\( f \\), which is even, so \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). That brings us back to \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so yes, it's definitely even.\n\nIs there a possibility that this could be neither? Hmm, not unless maybe the composition somehow disrupts the evenness or oddness in a non-uniform way, but in this case, each step follows from the properties of even and odd functions.\n\nWait, let me think about function composition in general. So, if I have f(g(x)), where f is even and g is odd, does it always result in an even function?\n\nLet me test with concrete functions. Let me choose f(x) = x\u00b2 (which is even) and g(x) = x\u00b3 (which is odd). Then, f(g(x)) = (x\u00b3)\u00b2 = x\u2076, which is even, because substituting -x gives (-x)^6 = x^6, same as f(g(x)). So that's consistent.\n\nAnother example: Let f(x) = cos(x) which is even, and g(x) = sin(x) which is odd. Then f(g(x)) = cos(sin(x)). Now, is this even? Let's test for x:\n\nf(g(-x)) = cos(sin(-x)) = cos(-sin(x)) = cos(sin(x)) because cosine is even. Therefore, f(g(-x)) = f(g(x)), so it is even. Therefore, this composition is also even.\n\nConversely, if I have f(x) even and g(x) odd, another thought: What if f is a reflection or something else? Wait, f and g are arbitrary functions with those parity properties. So as long as f is even, applying f to an odd function in this way gives an even result.\n\nWait a sec, but in the composition, do we ensure anything about the function's expression? For instance, is it always that way regardless of what f and g are, as long as f is even and g is odd?\n\nLet me see. Suppose f is another even function, say f(x) = x^4, and g(x) = x^3. Then, f(g(x)) = (x^3)^4 = x^{12}, which is even. So it still holds. What if I choose f(x) = |x|, which is even, and g(x) = x^3, which is odd? Then f(g(x)) is |x^3|, which is even as | -x^3 | = |x^3|. So yes.\n\nWhat if g(x) is a more complicated odd function? For example, \\( g(x) = x - x^3 \\). Wait, is that odd? Let's check: g(-x) = (-x) - (-x)^3 = -x - (-x^3) = -x + x^3. Which is not equal to -g(x), because -g(x) = -x + x^3. So in that case, g(x) would satisfy g(-x) = -g(x), meaning it is still odd.\n\nThen, \\( f(g(x)) = (x - x^3)^2 \\), which is even, because squared removes any negative signs.\n\nAlternatively, let me try another approach without plugging in specific functions. Let's compose f and g symbolically.\n\nSince \\( f(x) \\) is even, we know \\( f(-a) = f(a) \\) for any \\( a \\). Let \\( a = g(x^3) \\), then \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). Now, \\( g \\) is odd, so \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). So if I consider \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\), but as \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\). So \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so \\( h(x) \\) is even.\n\nThus, in every case, regardless of what f and g are (as long as f is even and g is odd), the composition \\( f \\circ g \\circ (-x^3) \\) will result in an even function.\n\nWait a moment, what if I made a mistake in how the functions compose? Hmm, the composition is \\( f(g(x^3)) \\), so x is cubed first, then g is applied, then f is applied. So \\( x^3 \\) is in the inner argument of g, which is odd, and then f is an even function on that result.\n\nHmm, another thing, let's suppose \\( f \\) is a non-trivial even function and \\( g \\) is a non-trivial odd function. Is their composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) necessarily even? Since the composition only involves substituting \\( -x \\) into \\( g(x^3) \\), which, since \\( g \\) is odd, negates the whole expression, but then \\( f \\) is even, so it doesn't negate anything.\n\nSo seems like no matter what, substituting \\( -x \\) in the outermost function doesn't change the result because \\( f \\) is even, negating the entire inner function, but after \\( g \\) is already odd.\n\nTherefore, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\nBut wait, just to test an example where perhaps the composition would not be even? Is that possible?\n\nWait, if we mess with the order, for example, suppose \\( f(g x) \\) then cube it, but in our case, it's \\( f(g(x^3)) \\), so the structure is fixed. Maybe if the functions were inside differently, but here it's as above.\n\nAlternatively, taking \\( x \\rightarrow -x \\):\n\nf(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(-x^3)) because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\).  \nThen, since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).  \nThus, \\( f(-g(x^3)) \\).  \nBut \\( f \\) is even, so \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nSo again, we get \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so h is even.\n\nTherefore, in the given composition order, f(g(x^3)), where f is even, g is odd, \\( x^3 \\) is odd.\n\nTherefore, it's even.\n\nWait, so it can't be neither because it is equal to h(-x) = h(x). So that suggests it is even.\n\nBut maybe we can think if there is a case when it could be neither.\n\nIs there an instance where substituting the negative variable leads to something different that's not h(x) but not equal to h(-x)?\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nDefine a specific even f and odd g and see.\n\nLet f(x) = x^4 (even), g(x) = x^5 (odd), so f(g(x^3)) = (x^3)^5)^4? Wait, hold on. Wait, f(g(x)) is f(x^5) when given x^3.\n\nWait, wait, doh, let's fix that.\n\nWait, \\( f(g(x^3)) = (g(x^3))^4 \\) because f(x) is x^4. So if \\( g(x) = x^5 \\), then \\( g(x^3) = (x^3)^5 = x^{15} \\), so \\( f(g(x^3)) = (x^{15})^4 = x^{60} \\). Then, since that's even because x^{60} is even, same as x^{60} is (-x)^{60} = x^{60}.\n\nWait, so that's an example of an even function.\n\nAnother example, let\u2019s take f(x) = cos(x), which is even, and g(x) = sin(x), which is odd. Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\). Wait, sin is odd, so sin(x^3) is odd because it's composed with x^3 which is odd (and sin is odd: sin(-y) = -sin(y)). So sin(x^3) is odd.\n\nThen, cos is even, so cos(-y) = cos(y). So cos(sin(x^3)) = cos(-sin(x)) = cos(sin(x)). So this is equality, hence, h(-x) = h(x), so it is even.\n\nWait, but actually \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is a function whose evenness we've established, so in all cases, function h(x) satisfies h(-x) = h(x). So, h is even.\n\nTherefore, despite the compositions, h is even.\n\nSo, in all steps, the result becomes even.\n\nConclusion: \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine whether the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\nFirst, recall the definitions:\n- An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\).\n- An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\nWe need to analyze the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\).

        "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c><\uff5cUser\uff5c>Please solve the following mathematical problem, placing your final answer within \\boxed{}:\nIf $f(x)$ is an even function and $g(x)$ is an odd function, find if $f(g(x^3))$ is even, odd, or neither.\n\nEnter \"odd\", \"even\", or \"neither\".<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem: f(x) is an even function and g(x) is an odd function. I need to figure out whether f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, odd, or neither. Hmm, let's start by recalling what it means for a function to be even or odd.\n\nAn even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain. On the other hand, an odd function satisfies g(-x) = -g(x) for all x in its domain. So, f(x) is even, meaning if I plug in -x, it's the same as plugging in x. And g(x) is odd, meaning plugging in -x flips the sign of the function.\n\nI need to analyze the function h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)). Let's see, I should check if h(-x) equals h(x) or -h(x) or neither. That will tell me if h(x) is even, odd, or neither.\n\nStarting with h(-x), which is f(g((-x)\u00b3)). Let me compute the inside first: (-x)\u00b3. Since any odd power preserves the sign, (-x)\u00b3 = -x\u00b3. So, h(-x) becomes f(g(-x\u00b3)).\n\nNow, since g is an odd function, g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). So, substituting that back, h(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)). \n\nNow, looking at f(-g(x\u00b3)). Since f is even, f(-t) = f(t) for any t. Let's set t = g(x\u00b3). So, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)). Therefore, h(-x) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nBut wait, f(g(x\u00b3)) is exactly h(x). So, h(-x) = h(x). That means h(x) is even. \n\nLet me recap to make sure. Starting with h(-x), substitute in, use the properties of f and g. Since g is odd, (-x)^3 is -x\u00b3, and then since f is even, f of negative something is just f of that something. So, h(-x) equals h(x), hence h is even. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in that reasoning. The key steps were recognizing that x\u00b3 is odd, so (-x)\u00b3 is -x\u00b3, then using the oddness of g to bring out the negative, and then the evenness of f to remove the negative. It all works out that h(-x) equals h(x).\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider specific examples to see if it makes sense. Suppose g(x) is something simple, like g(x) = x, which is odd. Then g(x\u00b3) = x\u00b3. So then f(g(x\u00b3)) = f(x\u00b3). Now, f is even, so f(-x\u00b3) = f(x\u00b3). Therefore, f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-x\u00b3) = f(x\u00b3) = f(g(x\u00b3)), which shows that h(-x) = h(x), confirming that h is even.\n\nAlternatively, take g(x) = x\u00b3, which is also odd. Then, g(x\u00b3) = x\u2079, which is also odd. Then, h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = f(x\u2079). Since f is even, plugging in x\u2079 or -x\u2079 doesn't change the value; f(x\u2079) = f(-x\u2079). Therefore, h(-x\u00b3) = f(-x\u2079) = f(x\u2079) = h(x\u00b3), so again h is even. \n\nWait, actually, no\u2014hold on, in this case, since h(-x) is f(g((-x)^3)) = f((-x)^3 * something). Wait, maybe examples can be tricky because the function might behave differently. Let me think of another example.\n\nSay f(x) is x\u00b2, which is even. Let g(x) be x\u00b3, which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) would be (x\u00b3)\u00b2 = x\u2076, which is even. Because f(g(-x\u00b3)) = (-x\u00b3)\u00b2 = x\u2076, which is same as f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nAnother example, f(x) = |x|, which is even. Take g(x) = x - x\u00b3, which is odd since -g(x) = -(x - x\u00b3) = -x + x\u00b3 = - (x - x\u00b3) = g(-x). So f(g(x\u00b3)) = |x\u00b3 - (x\u00b3)\u00b3| = |x\u00b3 - x\u2079|. Now, f(g(-x\u00b3)) = |(-x\u00b3) - (-x\u00b3)^3| = | -x\u00b3 - (-x\u2079)| = | -x\u00b3 + x\u2079 | = |x\u2079 -x\u00b3|. Since absolute value doesn't care about the sign, this is the same as |x\u00b3 - x\u2079| which is equal to f(g(x\u00b3)). So, h(-x\u00b3) = h(x\u00b3), meaning h is even.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So the conclusion is that in these cases, it seems to hold. So, probably the answer is even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\nAn even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) and an odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\nLet \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nTo determine if \\( h(x) \\) is even or odd, we evaluate \\( h(-x) \\):\n- \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\)\n- Since \\((-x)^3 = -x^3\\), we have \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\)\n- Because \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\), so \\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\)\n- Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\)\n\nThus, \\( h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\), which means \\( h(x) \\) is even.\n\nTherefore, the function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\(\\boxed{even}\\).<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>"

Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you multiply two polynomials, the degree of the resulting polynomial is the sum of the degrees of the two polynomials being multiplied. Here, the left side is (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) multiplied by p(x), and the right side is a fourth-degree polynomial, which is x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25. So, if I let the degree of p(x) be n, then 2 + n = 4 because the left side will have degree 2 + n. Therefore, n must be 2, which means p(x) is a quadratic polynomial. So, p(x) must be of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are constants that I need to find.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation: (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5)(ax\u00b2 + bx + c) = x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25. My job is to expand the left side and then compare the coefficients with the right side to find a, b, and c.\n\nLet me expand the left side step by step. I'll distribute each term in (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) across each term in (ax\u00b2 + bx + c):\n\nFirst, multiply x\u00b2 by each term in (ax\u00b2 + bx + c):\n- x\u00b2 * ax\u00b2 = a x\u2074\n- x\u00b2 * bx = b x\u00b3\n- x\u00b2 * c = c x\u00b2\n\nNext, multiply -3x by each term in (ax\u00b2 + bx + c):\n- -3x * ax\u00b2 = -3a x\u00b3\n- -3x * bx = -3b x\u00b2\n- -3x * c = -3c x\n\nThen, multiply 5 by each term in (ax\u00b2 + bx + c):\n- 5 * ax\u00b2 = 5a x\u00b2\n- 5 * bx = 5b x\n- 5 * c = 5c\n\nSo, combining all these terms, the left side becomes:\na x\u2074 + b x\u00b3 + c x\u00b2 - 3a x\u00b3 - 3b x\u00b2 - 3c x + 5a x\u00b2 + 5b x + 5c\n\nNow, I need to combine the like terms:\n\nFor x\u2074: a x\u2074\n\nFor x\u00b3: b x\u00b3 - 3a x\u00b3 = (b - 3a) x\u00b3\n\nFor x\u00b2: c x\u00b2 - 3b x\u00b2 + 5a x\u00b2 = (c - 3b + 5a) x\u00b2\n\nFor x: -3c x + 5b x = ( -3c + 5b ) x\n\nConstant term: 5c\n\nSo, putting it all together, the expanded form is:\na x\u2074 + (b - 3a) x\u00b3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x\u00b2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c\n\nNow, this should be equal to the right side, x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25.\n\nTherefore, we can set up equations by comparing coefficients for each power of x.\n\nLet me write down these equations:\n\n1. Coefficient of x\u2074: a = 1\n2. Coefficient of x\u00b3: b - 3a = -3\n3. Coefficient of x\u00b2: c - 3b + 5a = 0 (since there's no x\u00b2 term on the right side)\n4. Coefficient of x: (-3c + 5b) = 15\n5. Constant term: 5c = -25\n\nOkay, now I can solve these equations step by step.\n\nStarting with equation 1: a = 1. That gives me a = 1.\n\nPlug a = 1 into equation 2: b - 3(1) = -3 => b - 3 = -3. Adding 3 to both sides gives b = 0.\n\nNow, with a = 1 and b = 0, let's move to equation 3: c - 3(0) + 5(1) = 0 => c + 5 = 0 => c = -5.\n\nNow, check equation 4 with b = 0 and c = -5: (-3*(-5) + 5*0) = 15 + 0 = 15, which matches the right side (15). So, equation 4 is satisfied.\n\nFinally, equation 5: 5c = -25. With c = -5, let's check this: 5*(-5) = -25, which is correct.\n\nSo, all equations have been satisfied with a = 1, b = 0, c = -5. Therefore, the polynomial p(x) is ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 1x\u00b2 + 0x - 5, which simplifies to x\u00b2 - 5.\n\nLet me quickly double-check my solution by multiplying (x\u00b2 - 3x +5) by (x\u00b2 -5) to make sure I get x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25.\n\nMultiplying:\n\nFirst, x\u00b2 times x\u00b2 = x\u2074\n\nx\u00b2 times (-5) = -5x\u00b2\n\n-3x times x\u00b2 = -3x\u00b3\n\n-3x times (-5) = 15x\n\n5 times x\u00b2 = 5x\u00b2\n\n5 times (-5) = -25\n\nSo, combining:\n\nx\u2074\n\n-3x\u00b3\n\n-5x\u00b2 + 5x\u00b2 = 0x\u00b2\n\n15x\n\n-25\n\nSo, putting altogether: x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25, which is x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Perfect, that's exactly the right side. So, p(x) = x\u00b2 -5.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. Let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Also, just to be sure, is there any other way this could be approached?\n\nAnother possible method is polynomial division: divide x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x -25 by x\u00b2 -3x +5 and see if I get p(x).\n\nLet me try that.\n\nDivide x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25 by x\u00b2 -3x +5.\n\nSetting it up:\n\nDividend: x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +0x\u00b2 +15x -25\n\nDivisor: x\u00b2 -3x +5\n\nWe divide term by term.\n\nFirst term: x\u2074 divided by x\u00b2 is x\u00b2.\n\nMultiply divisor by x\u00b2: x\u00b2*(x\u00b2 -3x +5)=x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2\n\nSubtract this from the dividend:\n\n(x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +0x\u00b2 +15x -25) - (x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2) = 0x\u2074 +0x\u00b3 -5x\u00b2 +15x -25\n\nSo, now we have: -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nNext, divide this by the divisor x\u00b2 -3x +5. The leading term is -5x\u00b2 divided by x\u00b2 is -5.\n\nMultiply divisor by -5: -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nSubtract this from the current dividend:\n\n(-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) - (-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) = 0\n\nSo, no remainder. Thus, the quotient is x\u00b2 -5, which is exactly what I found earlier.\n\nOkay, that's another way to verify it, and the result is the same. So, p(x) is definitely x\u00b2 -5.\n\nWait, just one more check. Let me try synthetic division or another method.\n\nBut dividing a quartic by a quadratic, long division is probably straightforward, which I just did, and it worked.\n\nAlternatively, I can also try plugging in some values.\n\nLet me suppose p(x) = x\u00b2 -5, then when x=1, (1 -3 +5)p(1) = (3)(1 -5)=3*(-4)=-12; On the right side, x=1: 1 -3 +15 -25= (1-3)=-2, (15-25)=-10, so total is (-12). So, yes, it matches.\n\nAnother test, x=0: Left side: p(0)*(0 - 0 +5)=?\n\nWait, No, for x=0, plugging in, left side is (0 -0 +5)*p(0)=5*p(0). Right side is 0 -0 +0 -25 = -25. So, 5*p(0) = -25, which implies p(0)= -5. Looking at p(x)=x\u00b2 -5, p(0)=0 -5= -5, which is correct. That's consistent.\n\nTest another value: x=2. Left side: (4 -6 +5)*p(2)= (3)* (4 -5)=3*(-1)=-3.\n\nRight side: 16 -24 +30 -25= (16-24)= -8, (30-25)=5. So, (-8+5)= -3. Which matches. So, yeah, p(2) is 4-5=-1, and 3*(-1)= -3. That's good.\n\nHmm. Alright, I think I've verified it enough.\n\nThe polynomial p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\(\\boxed{x^2 - 5}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25\\), we start by noting that the degree of \\( p(x) \\) must be 2 since the product on the left side is a fourth-degree polynomial.

Coefficient in product: \\( b - 3a \\)\n   - Coefficient in given poly.: -3\n   - Equation: \\( b - 3a = -3 \\)\n   Since \\( a = 1 \\), substitute:\n   \\( b - 3(1) = -3 \\)\n   \\( b - 3 = -3 \\)\n   Add 3 to both sides: \\( b = 0 \\)\n\nHmm, so \\( b = 0 \\). Interesting, so the linear term in \\( p(x) \\) is zero. That might have been expected or not; let me keep going.\n\nNext, coefficient of \\( x^2 \\):\n3. Coefficient in product: \\( c - 3b + 5a \\)\n   - Coefficient in given poly.: 0 (since there is no \\( x^2 \\) term, it's implicitly 0)\n   So, equation: \\( c - 3b + 5a = 0 \\)\n   Substitute \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\):\n   \\( c - 0 + 5(1) = 0 \\)\n   \\( c + 5 = 0 \\)\n   Therefore, \\( c = -5 \\)\n\nOkay, moving on to the coefficient of \\( x \\):\n\n4. Coefficient in product: \\( -3c + 5b \\)\n   - Coefficient in given poly.: 15\n   So, equation: \\( -3c + 5b = 15 \\)\n   Substitute \\( b = 0 \\) and \\( c = -5 \\):\n   \\( -3*(-5) + 5*0 = 15 \\)\n   \\( 15 + 0 = 15 \\)\n   That's good, 15=15, which is consistent.\n\nLastly, the constant term:\n\n5. Coefficient in product: \\( 5c \\)\n   - Coefficient in given poly.: -25\n   So, equation: \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n   Substitute \\( c = -5 \\):\n   \\( 5*(-5) = -25 \\)\n   \\( -25 = -25 \\)\n   Perfect, that works out.\n\nSo, in summary, we found:\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = 0 \\)\n- \\( c = -5 \\)\n\nTherefore, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is:\n\n\\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = 1x^2 + 0x + (-5) = x^2 - 5 \\)\n\nLet me just verify this to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's multiply \\( x^2 - 3x +5 \\) by \\( x^2 - 5 \\) and check if we get the given quartic.\n\nMultiplying them together:\n\nFirst, \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)(x^2 - 5) \\)\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\n1. \\( x^2 * x^2 = x^4 \\)\n2. \\( x^2 * (-5) = -5x^2 \\)\n3. \\( -3x * x^2 = -3x^3 \\)\n4. \\( -3x * (-5) = 15x \\)\n5. \\( 5 * x^2 = 5x^2 \\)\n6. \\( 5 * (-5) = -25 \\)\n\nCombine these terms:\n\n\\( x^4 - 5x^2 - 3x^3 + 15x + 5x^2 -25 \\)\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n- \\( x^4 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 \\)\n- \\( (-5x^2 + 5x^2) = 0x^2 \\)\n- \\( 15x \\)\n- \\( -25 \\)\n\nSo the result is:\n\n\\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x -25 \\)\n\nWhich is exactly the given polynomial. So yes, that checks out. Therefore, my solution is correct.\n\nSo, to recap, by representing \\( p(x) \\) as a quadratic and matching coefficients, I found that \\( p(x) \\) is \\( x^2 - 5 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that\n\\[ (x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25, \\]\nwe start by noting that \\( p(x) \\) must be a quadratic polynomial, as the given polynomial is of degree 4 and we are multiplying by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).

Hmm, okay. So, essentially, I have the equation:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25\n\\]\n\nMy goal is to solve for \\( p(x) \\). I think a good way to approach this is by performing polynomial division, right? Because if I divide the right-hand side polynomial by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\), the result should be \\( p(x) \\). \n\nLet me recall how polynomial division works. It's kind of like long division with numbers, but involving polynomials. The steps are to divide the leading term of the dividend by the leading term of the divisor, multiply the entire divisor by that result, subtract from the dividend, and repeat the process with the new polynomial. \n\nSo first, let me write down the dividend and the divisor more clearly. The dividend is \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25 \\) because I notice that the original right-hand side didn't have an \\( x^2 \\) term, so I'll include a zero coefficient for that to make it easier. The divisor is \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\nLet me set up the long division:\n\nDividing \\( x^4 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) gives me \\( x^2 \\). So, I write \\( x^2 \\) above the division line. Then, I multiply \\( x^2 \\) by the divisor \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\), which gives me:\n\n\\( x^2 \\times x^2 = x^4 \\),\n\\( x^2 \\times (-3x) = -3x^3 \\),\n\\( x^2 \\times 5 = 5x^2 \\).\n\nSo, that gives \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).\n\nNext, I subtract this result from the original dividend:\n\n\\( (x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x -25) - (x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2) \\).\n\nLet me subtract term by term:\n\n- \\( x^4 - x^4 = 0 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 - (-3x^3) = 0 \\)\n- \\( 0x^2 - 5x^2 = -5x^2 \\)\n- \\( 15x - 0x = 15x \\)\n- \\( -25 - 0 = -25 \\)\n\nSo, the subtraction results in \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nNow, I bring down the remaining terms, but in this case, all terms have been accounted for, so the next dividend is \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nNow, I divide the leading term \\( -5x^2 \\) by the leading term of the divisor \\( x^2 \\), which is \\( -5 \\). So, I write \\( -5 \\) as the next term in the quotient.\n\nThen, I multiply \\( -5 \\) by the divisor \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\):\n\n\\( -5 \\times x^2 = -5x^2 \\),\n\\( -5 \\times (-3x) = 15x \\),\n\\( -5 \\times 5 = -25 \\).\n\nSo, that gives \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nAgain, I subtract this from the current polynomial:\n\n\\( (-5x^2 + 15x -25) - (-5x^2 + 15x -25) = 0 \\).\n\nSo, there's no remainder left, which is great. That means the division comes out perfectly, and the quotient is what I've found so far: \\( x^2 - 5 \\).\n\nWait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the beginning: I divided \\( x^4 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( x^2 \\), then multiplied \\( x^2 \\) by the divisor, got \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\), subtract that from \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25 \\), which gave me \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\). Then, I divided \\( -5x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( -5 \\), multiplied it by the divisor: \\( -5x^2 +15x -25 \\), and subtracted to get a remainder of 0. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the polynomial \\( p(x) = x^2 - 5 \\). Let me just verify by multiplying \\( x^2 - 3x +5 \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\) to see if I get the original polynomial.\n\nLet me perform this multiplication:\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( x^4 \\).\n\nThen \\( x^2 \\times -5 \\) gives \\( -5x^2 \\).\n\nNow, multiply \\( -3x \\) by \\( x^2 \\): \\( -3x^3 \\).\n\nThen, \\( -3x \\times -5 \\): \\( +15x \\).\n\nNext, \\( 5 \\times x^2 \\): \\( 5x^2 \\).\n\n\\( 5 \\times -5 \\): \\( -25 \\).\n\nSo now, writing all these terms together:\n\n\\( x^4 -5x^2 -3x^3 +15x +5x^2 -25 \\).\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\n\\( x^4 -3x^3 + (-5x^2 +5x^2) +15x -25 \\).\n\nSimplifies to:\n\n\\( x^4 -3x^3 + 0x^2 +15x -25 \\).\n\nWhich is exactly \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\), which is the given polynomial. \n\nSo, that confirms that when I multiply \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\), I indeed get the desired result.\n\nTherefore, I think my solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25,\n\\]\n\nwe perform polynomial long division of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n1. Divide the leading term \\( x^4 \\) by the leading term \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( x^2 \\).\n2. Multiply \\( x^2 \\) by the divisor \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) to get \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).\n3. Subtract this result from the original polynomial:\n   \\[\n   (x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25) - (x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2) = -5x^2 + 15x - 25.\n   \\]\n4. Divide the leading term \\( -5x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( -5 \\).\n5. Multiply \\( -5 \\) by the divisor \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) to get \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\).\n6. Subtract this result from the previous remainder:\n   \\[\n   (-5x^2 + 15x - 25) - (-5x^2 + 15x - 25) = 0.\n   \\]\n\nThe quotient from the division is \\( x^2 - 5 \\), and there is no remainder.

Let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that if I have two polynomials multiplied together and the result is another polynomial, the degrees of the polynomials should add up. Let me check, the degree of \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) is 2, and we're looking for \\( p(x) \\). The product is \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\), which is a degree 4 polynomial. So, since \\( 2 + \\text{degree of } p = 4 \\), the degree of \\( p(x) \\) must be \\( 2 \\). That makes sense. So \\( p(x) \\) is a quadratic polynomial.\n\nLet me denote \\( p(x) \\) as \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants that I need to find. \n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x -25 \\)\n\nAlright, now I need to multiply out the left-hand side and then equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \\( x \\) to the right-hand side. That way, I can set up equations for each coefficient and solve for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nLet me multiply \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) by \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\):\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 \\) by each term in \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\):\n- \\( x^2 \\times ax^2 = a x^4 \\)\n- \\( x^2 \\times bx = b x^3 \\)\n- \\( x^2 \\times c = c x^2 \\)\n\nNext, multiply \\( -3x \\) by each term:\n- \\( -3x \\times ax^2 = -3a x^3 \\)\n- \\( -3x \\times bx = -3b x^2 \\)\n- \\( -3x \\times c = -3c x \\)\n\nThen, multiply \\( 5 \\) by each term:\n- \\( 5 \\times ax^2 = 5a x^2 \\)\n- \\( 5 \\times bx = 5b x \\)\n- \\( 5 \\times c = 5c \\)\n\nNow let's write all these terms out:\n\n1. \\( a x^4 \\)\n2. \\( b x^3 + (-3a) x^3 \\) [since \\( b x^3 - 3a x^3 \\)]\n3. \\( c x^2 + (-3b) x^2 + 5a x^2 \\) [since \\( c x^2 - 3b x^2 + 5a x^2 \\)]\n4. \\( (-3c x) + (5b x) = (5b - 3c) x \\)\n5.

        "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c><\uff5cUser\uff5c>Please solve the following mathematical problem, placing your final answer within \\boxed{}:\nFind the polynomial $p(x)$ if\n$$(x^2-3x+5)p(x) = x^4-3x^3+15x-25.$$<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where I need to find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that when I multiply it by \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) \\), I get \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). Hmm, okay. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if I have two polynomials multiplied together and I can express one as the product of the other and another polynomial, division is the key. Since \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) \\) is a quadratic polynomial, and we're multiplying it by another polynomial \\( p(x) \\) to get a quartic (degree 4) polynomial. That means \\( p(x) \\) must be a quadratic polynomial itself because when you multiply a quadratic by a quadratic, you get a quartic.\n\nLet me write that down. If \\( p(x) \\) is quadratic, then I can express it as \\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\). Then, multiplying \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) \\) by \\( (ax^2 + bx + c) \\) should equal the given quartic. So, my goal is to find the coefficients \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nLet me set that up. The multiplication would look like:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c)\n\\]\n\nI need to expand this product and then equate it to the given polynomial \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). After expanding, I can compare coefficients of corresponding powers of \\( x \\) to set up equations for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nAlright, let's carry out the multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll distribute \\( ax^2 \\) across each term in the first polynomial:\n\n- \\( x^2 \\cdot ax^2 = a x^{4} \\)\n- \\( (-3x) \\cdot ax^2 = -3a x^{3} \\)\n- \\( 5 \\cdot ax^2 = 5a x^{2} \\)\n\nNext, distribute \\( bx \\) across each term in the first polynomial:\n\n- \\( x^2 \\cdot bx = b x^{3} \\)\n- \\( (-3x) \\cdot bx = -3b x^{2} \\)\n- \\( 5 \\cdot bx = 5b x \\)\n\nThen, distribute \\( c \\) across each term in the first polynomial:\n\n- \\( x^2 \\cdot c = c x^{2} \\)\n- \\( (-3x) \\cdot c = -3c x \\)\n- \\( 5 \\cdot c = 5c \\)\n\nNow, let's write all these terms out:\n\n1. \\( a x^{4} \\)\n2. \\( -3a x^{3} \\)\n3. \\( 5a x^{2} \\)\n4. \\( b x^{3} \\)\n5. \\( -3b x^{2} \\)\n6. \\( 5b x \\)\n7. \\( c x^{2} \\)\n8. \\( -3c x \\)\n9. \\( 5c \\)\n\nNext, I need to combine like terms.\n\nLooking for \\( x^{4} \\) terms: only the first term, which is \\( a x^{4} \\). So that coefficient is \\( a \\).\n\nFor \\( x^{3} \\) terms: we have \\( -3a x^{3} \\) and \\( b x^{3} \\), so when combined, it's \\( (-3a + b) x^{3} \\).\n\nFor \\( x^{2} \\) terms: \\( 5a x^{2} \\), \\( -3b x^{2} \\), and \\( c x^{2} \\), so combined, that's \\( (5a - 3b + c) x^{2} \\).\n\nFor \\( x \\) terms: \\( 5b x \\) and \\( -3c x \\), so combined, that's \\( (5b - 3c) x \\).\n\nAnd the constant term is just \\( 5c \\).\n\nSo summarizing, the entire expansion is:\n\n\\[\na x^{4} + (-3a + b) x^{3} + (5a - 3b + c)x^{2} + (5b - 3c) x + 5c\n\\]\n\nNow, we have this equal to the given polynomial \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). Let me write down that equation:\n\n\\[\na x^{4} + (-3a + b) x^{3} + (5a - 3b + c)x^{2} + (5b - 3c) x + 5c = x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25\n\\]\n\nWait a second, technically, the right-hand side doesn't show \\( x^2 \\) term, but technically, it's there with a coefficient of 0. That might be an important point. So, to properly set up the equations, I should compare coefficients for each degree.\n\nTherefore, the coefficients of corresponding powers must be equal. So, let's set them aside:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\):\n   \\( a = 1 \\) (Because RHS has 1 coefficient for \\( x^4 \\))\n\n2. Coefficient of \\( x^3 \\):\n   \\( -3a + b = -3 \\)\n\n3. Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\):\n   \\( 5a - 3b + c = 0 \\)\n\n4. Coefficient of \\( x \\):\n   \\( 5b - 3c = 15 \\)\n\n5. Constant term:\n   \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\nNow, that gives me a system of equations:\n\n1. \\( a = 1 \\)\n\n2. \\( -3a + b = -3 \\)\n\n3. \\( 5a - 3b + c = 0 \\)\n\n4. \\( 5b - 3c = 15 \\)\n\n5. \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\nAlright, let's solve this step by step.\n\nStarting with equation 1: \\( a = 1 \\). That\u2019s straightforward.\n\nMoving to equation 5: \\( 5c = -25 \\). Dividing both sides by 5, we get \\( c = -5 \\). So that gives us the value of \\( c \\).\n\nNow, let's plug \\( c = -5 \\) into equation 4: \\( 5b - 3c = 15 \\). Substituting:\n\n\\( 5b - 3*(-5) = 15 \\)\n\nCalculates to:\n\n\\( 5b + 15 = 15 \\)\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides: \\( 5b = 0 \\), so \\( b = 0 \\).\n\nOkay, now we have \\( b = 0 \\) and \\( c = -5 \\). Let's plug \\( a = 1 \\) into equation 2 to get \\( b \\). Wait, \\( a = 1 \\) and equation 2 is \\( -3a + b = -3 \\):\n\nSo, substituting \\( a = 1 \\):\n\n\\( -3(1) + b = -3 \\)\n\\( -3 + b = -3 \\)\nAdding 3 to both sides: \\( b = 0 \\). Okay, that matches the result from equation 4. Good, no contradictions there.\n\nNow, let's check equation 3: \\( 5a - 3b + c = 0 \\)\n\nWe know \\( a=1 \\), \\( b=0 \\), and \\( c=-5 \\):\n\n\\( 5(1) - 3(0) + (-5) = 5 - 0 -5 = 0 \\). Exactly, so equation 3 is satisfied.\n\nThus, all equations are consistent, and we have our values:\n\n\\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), \\( c = -5 \\)\n\nSo, putting it all together, the quadratic polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is:\n\n\\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = 1x^2 + 0x -5 = x^2 -5 \\)\n\nWait, hold on a moment. Let me just verify that to make sure we don't have a mistake.\n\nLet me compute \\( (x^2 - 3x +5)(x^2 -5) \\) and see if it equals \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\): that's \\( x^4 -5x^2 \\)\n\nNext, multiply \\( -3x \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\): that's \\( -3x^3 +15x \\)\n\nThen, multiply \\(5 \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\): that's \\( 5x^2 -25 \\)\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n\\( x^4 -5x^2 -3x^3 +15x +5x^2 -25 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- \\( x^4 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 \\)\n- \\( (-5x^2 +5x^2) = 0x^2 \\)\n- \\(15x \\)\n- \\( -25 \\)\n\nSo, the result is \\( x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25 \\). Which simplifies to \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\), which is exactly the polynomial we wanted. Perfect, so our solution is correct.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe we can perform polynomial long division as another method to see if \\( (x^2 - 3x +5) \\) divides into \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\) evenly, giving us \\( p(x) \\) as a quadratic.\n\nSo, if I perform \\( \\frac{x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25}{x^2 -3x +5} \\), the result should be \\( x^2 +0x -5 \\), which is \\( x^2 -5 \\).\n\nLet me set up the division:\n\nDivide \\( x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25 \\) by \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\).\n\n1. How many times does \\( x^2 \\) go into \\( x^4 \\)? It's \\( x^2 \\). Multiply \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\), which is \\( x^4 -3x^3 +5x^2 \\).\n\n2. Subtract this from the dividend:\n\n\\( (x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25) - (x^4 -3x^3 +5x^2) = 0x^4 +0x^3 -5x^2 +15x -25 \\)\n\n3. Now, bring down the next terms\u2014but here, all the coefficients are there, so move on.\n\n4. How many times does \\( x^2 \\) go into \\( -5x^2 \\)? It's \\(-5\\). Multiply \\( -5 \\) by \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\), which is \\( -5x^2 +15x -25 \\).\n\n5. Subtract this from the current dividend:\n\n\\( (-5x^2 +15x -25) - (-5x^2 +15x -25) = 0x^2 +0x +0 \\)\n\nSo, no remainder, which is perfect, and the quotient is \\( x^2 -5 \\), which again matches our previous result. So it's double-checked.\n\nAlternatively, if I am unsure, maybe I can try plugging in some values to see if both sides are equal.\n\nFor instance, let\u2019s pick x = 1.\n\nCompute LHS: \\( (1^2 -3*1 +5)(1^2 -5) = (1 -3 +5)(1 -5) = (3)(-4) = -12 \\)\n\nCompute RHS: \\(1^4 -3*1^3 +15*1 -25 =1 -3 +15 -25= (1 -3) + (15 -25) = (-2) + (-10)= -12 \\). So that works.\n\nLet me try another value, say x=2.\n\nCompute LHS: \\( (4 -6 +5)(4 -5)= (3)(-1)= -3 \\)\n\nCompute RHS: 16 -24 +30 -25= (16-24) + (30-25)= (-8)+(5)= -3. That works too.\n\nHow about x=0? Let me see.\n\nLHS: \\( (0 -0 +5)(0 -5)=5*(-5)= -25 \\)\n\nRHS: 0 +0 +0 -25= -25. That matches as well.\n\nAnother test at x= -1.\n\nLHS: (1 +3 +5)(1 -5)=9*(-4)= -36\n\nRHS: 1 +3 + (-15) -25=1 +3 -15 -25= 4 -40= -36. Perfect.\n\nSo, all tests are passing, confirming that our polynomial \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\nIs there another way to approach",

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I know that \\( p(x) \\) must be a polynomial because both \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) \\) and the result are polynomials. So, if I have a polynomial multiplied by a quadratic to get a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, that means \\( p(x) \\) must be a quadratic as well. Because if you multiply a quadratic by a quadratic, the highest degree term is 4. So, that suggests \\( p(x) \\) is a quadratic polynomial. \n\nLet me write that down. So, let me denote \\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants that I need to find. Got that.\n\nNow, the equation is \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). My task is to expand the left-hand side and then equate the coefficients with the right-hand side to find \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nSo, I'm going to proceed to expand \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c) \\).\n\nLet me recall that polynomial multiplication is done term by term. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and then like terms are combined.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n1. Multiply \\( x^2 \\) from the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\( x^2 \\cdot ax^2 = a x^{2+2} = a x^4 \\)\n   - \\( x^2 \\cdot bx = b x^{2+1} = b x^3 \\)\n   - \\( x^2 \\cdot c = c x^2 \\)\n\n2. Multiply \\( -3x \\) from the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\( -3x \\cdot ax^2 = -3a x^{1+2} = -3a x^3 \\)\n   - \\( -3x \\cdot bx = -3b x^{1+1} = -3b x^2 \\)\n   - \\( -3x \\cdot c = -3c x \\)\n\n3. Multiply \\( 5 \\) from the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\( 5 \\cdot ax^2 = 5a x^2 \\)\n   - \\( 5 \\cdot bx = 5b x \\)\n   - \\( 5 \\cdot c = 5c \\)\n\nNow, let me add up all these terms:\n\n- The \\( x^4 \\) term: \\( a x^4 \\)\n- The \\( x^3 \\) terms: \\( b x^3 - 3a x^3 \\) which combines to \\( (b - 3a) x^3 \\)\n- The \\( x^2 \\) terms: \\( c x^2 - 3b x^2 + 5a x^2 \\) which combines to \\( (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 \\)\n- The \\( x \\) terms: \\( -3c x + 5b x \\) which combines to \\( (-3c + 5b) x \\)\n- The constant term is \\( 5c \\ )\n\nSo, putting it all together, the expanded left-hand side becomes:\n\\( a x^4 + (b - 3a) x^3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c \\)\n\nNow, this must equal the right-hand side, which is \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). \n\nSo, let's write out the equation:\n\n\\[\na x^4 + (b - 3a) x^3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c = x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25\n\\]\n\nWait, hold on. When writing polynomials, the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) in the right-hand side is zero because there's no \\( x^2 \\) term. So I added \\( 0x^2 \\) to represent that. Similarly, the constants are 15 for \\( x \\) and -25 as the constant term.\n\nNow, since two polynomials are equal if and only if their corresponding coefficients of like terms are equal. So, let's set up equations for each coefficient:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\):\n   \\( a = 1 \\)\n\n2. Coefficient of \\( x^3 \\):\n   \\( b - 3a = -3 \\)\n\n3.

Constant term:\n   \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\nOkay, so now I have a system of equations to solve for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), \\( c \\).\n\nLet's solve step by step.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\\( a = 1 \\)\n\nPlugging this into equation 2:\n\\( b - 3(1) = -3 \\)\n\\( b - 3 = -3 \\)\nAdding 3 to both sides:\n\\( b = 0 \\)\n\nNow, plug \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\) into equation 3:\n\n\\( c - 3(0) + 5(1) = 0 \\)\nSimplify:\n\\( c - 0 + 5 = 0 \\)\n\\( c + 5 = 0 \\)\nSubtract 5:\n\\( c = -5 \\)\n\nThen, let's check equation 4:\n\\( -3c + 5b = 15 \\)\nPlugging \\( c = -5 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\):\n\\( -3(-5) + 5(0) = 15 \\)\nSimplify:\n15 + 0 = 15\n15 = 15. Okay, that's consistent.\n\nFinally, equation 5:\n\\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\\( c = -5 \\)\nWhich is the same result as above.\n\nSo, all equations are consistent, and we've got \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), \\( c = -5 \\).\n\nTherefore, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is:\n\n\\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = 1x^2 + 0x -5 = x^2 -5 \\)\n\nWait a minute, so \\( p(x) \\) is \\( x^2 - 5 \\)? Let me verify that.\n\nLet me multiply \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) \\) by \\( (x^2 -5) \\):\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 \\cdot x^2 = x^4 \\)\n\n\\( x^2 \\cdot (-5) = -5x^2 \\)\n\nThen, \\( -3x \\cdot x^2 = -3x^3 \\)\n\n\\( -3x \\cdot (-5) = 15x \\)\n\nThen, \\( 5 \\cdot x^2 = 5x^2 \\)\n\n\\( 5 \\cdot (-5) = -25 \\)\n\nNow, let me add all these together:\n\n- \\( x^4 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 \\)\n- \\( -5x^2 + 5x^2 = 0x^2 \\)\n- \\( 15x \\)\n- \\( -25 \\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x -25 \\), which is exactly the given polynomial.\n\nSo, indeed, \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\) is the correct polynomial.\n\nBut, just to double-check, maybe do the multiplication in a different way, maybe vertically.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n      x^2 - 3x + 5\n    *    x^2 - 5\n    ---------------\nMultiply each term:\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 -5 \\) by 5: 5*(x^2 -5) = 5x^2 -25\n\nThen, multiply \\( x^2 -5 \\) by (-3x): -3x*(x^2 -5) = -3x^3 +15x\n\nThen, multiply \\( x^2 -5 \\) by x^2: x^2*(x^2 -5) = x^4 -5x^2\n\nNow, add them all up:\n\nFirst term: x^4 -5x^2\nSecond term: -3x^3 +15x\nThird term: 5x^2 -25\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx^4: 1x^4\nx^3: -3x^3\nx^2: -5x^2 +5x^2 = 0\nx terms: 15x\nconstants: -25\n\nSo altogether:\nx^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 which matches.\n\nSo yeah, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use polynomial division? Let me think.\n\nIf I have \\( (x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25) \\) divided by \\( (x^2 -3x +5) \\), I should get \\( p(x) \\). Maybe checking through polynomial division.\n\nSo, dividing \\( x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25 \\) by \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\). Hmm.\n\nSet it up like polynomial long division:\n\nDividing \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 +15x -25 \\) by \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\)\n\nFirst term: \\( x^4 \\) divided by \\( x^2 \\) gives \\( x^2 \\). So, multiply divisor \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\) by \\( x^2 \\), giving \\( x^4 -3x^3 +5x^2 \\)\n\nSubtract that from the dividend:\n\n\\( (x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25 ) - (x^4 -3x^3 +5x^2 ) = 0x^4 +0x^3 -5x^2 +15x -25 \\)\n\nSo now, the remainder is \\( -5x^2 +15x -25 \\)\n\nNext term: Divide \\( -5x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) gives -5. Multiply divisor by -5: \\( -5x^2 +15x -25 \\)\n\nSubtracting this from the current remainder:\n\n\\( (-5x^2 +15x -25 ) - (-5x^2 +15x -25 ) = 0 \\)\n\nSo, the remainder is zero, and the quotient is \\( x^2 -5 \\).\n\nHence, \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\) which confirms the earlier result. \n\nWait, doing polynomial division helped solidify that. So yeah, whether I do the expansion and equate coefficients, or I do the polynomial division, both methods point to \\( p(x) being equal to \\( x^2 -5 \\ ). \n\nSo, to recap:\n\nGiven equation \\( (x^2 -3x +5)p(x) = x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\), we determined that \\( p(x) \\) must be quadratic, expressed it as \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), expanded the product, equated coefficients with the given quartic, solved the system, found \\( a=1 \\), \\( b=0 \\), \\( c=-5 \\), hence \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\). Then, double-checked using multiplication, and through polynomial division as an additional verification. \n\nTherefore, the solution is consistent and correct.

Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if I have two polynomials multiplied together resulting in another polynomial, I can use polynomial division to find one polynomial if I know the other. In this case, I have the divisor (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) and the dividend is the result, which is x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25. So, I guess I need to divide x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25 by (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) to get p(x).\n\nLet me write this out: p(x) = (x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25) divided by (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5). Dividing polynomials usually involves polynomial long division. I've heard of this before; it's similar to dividing numbers, but with polynomials. I need to make sure I line up the terms properly.\n\nFirst, let me write both polynomials with their degrees in order. The dividend is a quartic (degree 4), and the divisor is a quadratic (degree 2). So, in long division, the divisor goes into the dividend.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2003_______________\nx\u00b2 - 3x + 5 ) x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25\n\nWait, I notice that in the dividend, there's no x\u00b2 term. So I should insert a placeholder with coefficient zero to make it easier. So, the dividend becomes x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nNow, I'll start the division.\n\nFirst term: x\u2074 divided by x\u00b2 is x\u00b2. So, the first term of the quotient is x\u00b2.\n\nMultiply the entire divisor by x\u00b2: x\u00b2*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2.\n\nSubtract this from the dividend:\n\n(x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25) - (x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2) =\n\nx\u2074 - x\u2074 = 0\n\n-3x\u00b3 - (-3x\u00b3) = 0\n\n0x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 = -5x\u00b2\n\n15x remains.\n\n-25 remains.\n\nSo now, the new polynomial is -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nBring down the terms, but since we've subtracted completely, the next step is to divide this new polynomial by the divisor.\n\nNext term: -5x\u00b2 divided by x\u00b2 is -5.\n\nMultiply the divisor by -5: -5*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nSubtract this from the current polynomial:\n\n(-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) - (-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) = 0\n\nSo, there's no remainder.\n\nSo, adding the two terms, x\u00b2 and -5, gives the quotient as x\u00b2 -5.\n\nTherefore, p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\nLet me check if that's correct. Multiply p(x) by (x\u00b2 -3x +5) and see if we get x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25.\n\nWell, (x\u00b2 -5)(x\u00b2 -3x +5).\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nx\u00b2*(x\u00b2) = x\u2074\n\nx\u00b2*(-3x) = -3x\u00b3\n\nx\u00b2*5 =5x\u00b2\n\n-5*(x\u00b2) = -5x\u00b2\n\n-5*(-3x)=15x\n\n-5*5 = -25\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx\u2074\n\n-3x\u00b3\n\n5x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 =0x\u00b2\n\n15x\n\n-25\n\nSo, we get x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 +0x\u00b2 +15x -25, which is equal to the given dividend x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +0x\u00b2 +15x -25. That checks out. So p(x) is indeed x\u00b2 -5. Cool.\n\nWait, let me recap the division steps because I want to make sure I didn't make any mistake there.\n\n1. Checked if I have all the missing terms with zero coefficients, which I did.\n\n2. First term: x\u2074 divided by x\u00b2 is x\u00b2. Multiply divisor by x\u00b2 gives x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2.\n\n3. Subtracted that, got 0 for x\u2074 and x\u00b3, -5x\u00b2 remains because 0x\u00b2 was there and 5x\u00b2 was subtracted.\n\n4. Then, next term is -5x\u00b2 /x\u00b2 is -5. Multiply divisor by -5, which is -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\n5. Subtract that from the current -5x\u00b2 +15x -25, and everything cancels out, remainder zero.\n\nSo, quotient is x\u00b2 -5. Therefore, p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\nI was a bit nervous when subtracting the polynomials, but breaking it down step by step seems to hold. Let me just visualize the multiplication again:\n\n(x\u00b2 -5)(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = x\u00b2*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) -5*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 +15x -25. As you can see, 5x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 cancels, and then you're left with x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25, which is exactly the given polynomial.\n\nSo, yeah, I think I'm confident that p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25\\), we perform polynomial long division of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n1. **Set up the division**: Divide \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n2. **First term**: \\( x^4 \\) divided by \\( x^2 \\) gives \\( x^2 \\).\n3. **Multiply and subtract**: Multiply \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) to get \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).

Hmm, interesting. I'm going to need to figure out what p(x) is. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that if I have two polynomials multiplied together and that their product is given, I can find the unknown polynomial by division. So p(x) must be the result when I divide x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25 by x\u00b2 - 3x + 5. That makes sense because polynomial division is like the opposite of multiplication. So I can set this up as a long division problem.\n\nAlright, let me write down the division. The dividend is x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 + 15x - 25, wait, why 0x\u00b2? Oh, because in the original polynomial x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25, the x\u00b2 term is missing. So I need to include a zero coefficient for that term to make the division accurate. Otherwise, I might misalign terms later on.\n\nSo, the divisor is x\u00b2 - 3x + 5. Let's set up the long division: \n\nWe start by dividing the first term of the dividend, which is x\u2074, by the first term of the divisor, which is x\u00b2. That gives x\u00b2. So, the first term of the quotient is x\u00b2. Now, multiply the entire divisor by x\u00b2 to get x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 5x\u00b2. \n\nSubtracting this from the dividend, we have:\n\n(x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 + 15x - 25) minus (x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 5x\u00b2) equals 0x\u2074 + 0x\u00b3 -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nSo now, the new polynomial to work with is -5x\u00b2 +15x -25. Now, we take the first term of this, which is -5x\u00b2, and divide it by the first term of the divisor, which is x\u00b2. That gives us -5. So, the next term in the quotient is -5.\n\nMultiply the divisor by -5: -5x\u00b2 +15x -25. Subtract that from our current polynomial:\n\n(-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) minus (-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) equals 0x\u00b2 +0x +0.\n\nOh, wow, that subtracted perfectly with no remainder. So putting it all together, the quotient is x\u00b2 -5, and the remainder is zero, which is exactly what we needed. So p(x) must be x\u00b2 -5.\n\nBut wait, hold on a second. Let me just verify that I did everything correctly because sometimes math can be tricky. So, we constructed p(x) as x\u00b2 -5 and multiplied it by (x\u00b2 -3x +5) to see if we get the original polynomial.\n\nLet me do that multiplication step by step:\n\n(x\u00b2 -5)(x\u00b2 -3x +5). Let's distribute each term:\n\nFirst, x\u00b2*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2.\n\nThen, -5*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nNow, add those two results together:\n\nx\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-5x\u00b2 +5x\u00b2 cancels out, so 0x\u00b2. Then, we have x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Which is exactly the right-hand side of the equation given. That checks out.\n\nSo yes, p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25\\), we need to perform polynomial division of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n1. **Set up the division**: The dividend is \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25 \\) (including a placeholder for the missing \\( x^2 \\) term) and the divisor is \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n2. **First term of the quotient**: Divide the first term of the dividend \\( x^4 \\) by the first term of the divisor \\( x^2 \\), giving \\( x^2 \\).\n\n3. **Multiply and subtract**: Multiply the entire divisor by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).

First, I need to divide \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x -25 \\) (since there's no \\( x^2 \\) term) by \\( x^2 - 3x +5 \\).\n\nLet me set it up:\n\nDividend: \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x -25 \\)\nDivisor: \\( x^2 - 3x +5 \\)\n\nI start by dividing the leading term of the dividend \\( x^4 \\) by the leading term of the divisor \\( x^2 \\).

So, the next term of the quotient is \\( -5 \\).\n\nNow, multiply the entire divisor by \\( -5 \\):\n\n\\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) * (-5) = -5x^2 + 15x -25 \\).\n\nSubtracting this from the previous remainder:\n\n\\( (-5x^2 +15x -25 ) - (-5x^2 +15x -25 ) \\)\n\nSubtracting term by term:\n\n- \\( -5x^2 - (-5x^2) = 0 \\)\n- \\( 15x -15x = 0 \\)\n- \\( -25 - (-25) =0 \\)\n\nSo, the remainder is 0.\n\nTherefore, the division is exact, and the quotient is the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) which we found through division. The quotient started as \\( x^2 \\) and then became \\( x^2 -5 \\) after the next term.\n\nSo, putting it all together, \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\).\n\nWait, let me verify this. If I multiply \\( (x^2 -3x +5) \\) by \\( (x^2 -5) \\), do I get \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\)?\n\nMultiplying \\( x^2 * x^2 = x^4 \\).\nThen, \\( x^2 * (-5) = -5x^2 \\).\nNext, \\( -3x * x^2 = -3x^3 \\).\nThen, \\( -3x * (-5) = 15x \\).\nNow, \\(5* x^2 =5x^2\\).\nThen,5* (-5) = -25.\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n- \\( x^4 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 \\)\n- \\( -5x^2 +5x^2 = 0x^2 \\)\n- \\( +15x \\)\n- \\( -25 \\)\n\nSo, the product is \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\), which is exactly what was given. Therefore, the division was correct, and p(x) is indeed \\( x^2 -5 \\).\n\nAnother way I thought about this problem is by factoring. I know that if we have \\( (x^2 -3x +5)p(x) = x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\), maybe we can factor the right-hand side. Sometimes factoring can reveal the structure needed.\n\nLet me try to factor \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\). Hmm, factoring quartic polynomials can be tricky, but maybe it's a product of quadratics or something. Alternatively, perhaps it can be factored as the product of \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\) and another quadratic. Let me check.\n\nLet\u2019s assume \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 = (x^2 -3x +5)(px^2 + qx + r) \\). If I can find p, q, r such that this holds, then that will help me get p(x). Alternatively, p is the quadratic we just found, but to see whether this works.\n\nMultiplying out the right-hand side:\n\n\\( (x^2 -3x +5)(px^2 + qx + r) \\)\n= \\( x^2(px^2 + qx + r) -3x(px^2 + qx + r) + 5(px^2 + qx + r) \\)\n= \\( px^4 + qx^3 + rx^2 -3px^3 -3qx^2 -3rx +5px^2 +5qx +5r \\)\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\n- \\( x^4: p \\)\n- \\( x^3: q -3p \\)\n- \\( x^2: r -3q +5p \\)\n- \\( x: -3r +5q \\)\n- Constant term: 5r\n\nNow, the left-hand side is \\( x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25 \\). So, setting up equations by equating coefficients:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\): p =1\n2. Coefficient of \\( x^3 \\): q -3p = -3\n3. Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\): r -3q +5p =0\n4. Coefficient of \\( x \\): -3r +5q =15\n5. Constant term: 5r = -25\n\nSo, let's solve these equations:\n\nFrom equation 1: p =1\n\nFrom equation 2: q -3(1) = -3 \u2192 q -3 = -3 \u2192 q=0\n\nFrom equation 5: 5r = -25 \u2192 r = -5\n\nNow, from equation 3: r -3q +5p = (-5) -0 +5(1) =0? Let's test:\n\nr -3q +5p = -5 -0 +5 =0, which is correct.\n\nAnd from equation 4: -3r +5q = -3(-5) + 0 =15, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, p=1, q=0, r=-5.\n\nTherefore, the quadratic factor is \\( x^2 +0x -5 =x^2 -5 \\). So, indeed, \\( p(x)=x^2 -5 \\). Therefore, factoring confirms the division result.\n\nAnother method I could consider is using synthetic division or other factoring techniques, but since both polynomial division and factoring lead me to the same result, I\u2019m confident that \\( p(x) =x^2 -5 \\).\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can graph both polynomials and see if their product makes sense, but graphing often isn't necessary if all the algebraic methods confirm the solution.\n\nAlternatively, I can plug in a value for x into both sides and verify.\n\nLet\u2019s pick x=1:\n\nCompute LHS: (1^2 -3*1 +5)*p(1) = (1 -3 +5)*p(1)=3*p(1)\nCompute RHS:1^4 -3*1^3 +15*1 -25 =1 -3 +15 -25= (1-3)= -2, (-2 +15)=13, (13-25)=-12. So RHS value at x=1 is -12.\nThus, 3*p(1)=-12, so p(1)= -4.\n\nNow, p(x)=x^2 -5, so p(1)=1 -5= -4. It matches.\n\nAnother test with x=2:\n\nLHS: (4 -6 +5)*p(2)= (3)*p(2)\nRHS:16 -24 +30 -25= (16-24)= -8, (-8+30)=22, (22-25)= -3. So RHS at x=2 is -3.\nTherefore, 3*p(2)= -3, so p(2)= -1.\n\nCompute p(2)= 4 -5= -1. That checks out.\n\nOne more test with x=0:\n\nLHS: (0 -0 +5)*p(0)=5*p(0)\nRHS:0 -0 +0 -25= -25. So, 5*p(0)= -25, p(0)= -5.\n\nCompute p(0)=0 -5= -5. That also works.\n\nSo, all my test points are satisfied, which adds more confidence that p(x)=x^2 -5 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way is to notice that the given polynomial x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 might be factorable into two quadratics, one of which is x^2 -3x +5, so if I can factor it, that gives me p(x).\n\nBut perhaps an even quicker check is to plug in x= something that makes p(x) zero or something, but maybe not necessary here since the previous thoroughness is sufficient.\n\nThinking through, am I making any incorrect assumptions? The original setup is a product of polynomials and getting the quotient by division, but since both polynomials have integer coefficients, it's likely to be with lesser chance of error. Moreover, synthetic division would be faster if I thought in terms of factoring in (x - a), but in this case, since it's a quadratic, it's a bit more involved.\n\nBut as I already confirmed with factoring by coefficient comparison, it's sufficient. So, I think I'm confident that p(x)=x\u00b2 -5 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, just one thing\u2014when I first thought of polynomial division, I said the process, but then I thought of factoring, so maybe someone might get confused whether the factoring is necessary or not.\n\nBut in this case, since the question is phrased as multiplying p(x) and (x\u00b2 -3x +5), so actually, it's possible to state that p(x) is equal to the division. Thus, either method works.\n\nBut perhaps factoring can be a method in cases when known factors are present. For example, if both the dividend and divisor had some common factor, but in this case, I don't think that's applicable.\n\nAnother thought: maybe sometimes polynomials can have multiple factors or roots, but in this case, since the divisor is quadratic, and having found the other quadratic factor, that's sufficient. And it's another good check that after multiplying the two quadratics, one of them being known, I get back the dividend.\n\nThus, all in all, I think I\u2019ve approached the problem in multiple ways, and all confirm that \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\), we need to perform polynomial division of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n1.

Hmm, okay. Let's see. I guess p(x) must be a polynomial as well, right? Because if I multiply (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) by p(x) and get a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, then p(x) has to be a quadratic (degree 2), since 2 (from x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) plus 2 (from p(x)) equals 4. That makes sense.\n\nSo, let me write p(x) as a general quadratic: p(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c. That seems like a good start because it covers all possibilities for a second-degree polynomial.\n\nNow, the equation given is (x\u00b2 - 3x +5)(ax\u00b2 + bx + c) = x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Okay, so if I multiply these two polynomials together, I should end up with that result. Therefore, I can expand the left-hand side and then set the coefficients equal to those on the right-hand side. Since the coefficients of corresponding powers of x must be equal for the two polynomials to be equal, I can set up equations and solve for a, b, and c.\n\nLet me go ahead and perform that multiplication. I'll multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.\n\nFirst, take x\u00b2 multiplied by each term in p(x):\n\n- x\u00b2 * ax\u00b2 = a x\u2074\n- x\u00b2 * bx = b x\u00b3\n- x\u00b2 * c = c x\u00b2\n\nThen, take -3x multiplied by each term in p(x):\n\n- -3x * ax\u00b2 = -3a x\u00b3\n- -3x * bx = -3b x\u00b2\n- -3x * c = -3c x\n\nNext, take +5 multiplied by each term in p(x):\n\n- 5 * ax\u00b2 = 5a x\u00b2\n- 5 * bx = 5b x\n- 5 * c = 5c\n\nNow, let's combine all those terms:\n\n= a x\u2074\n+ b x\u00b3 + c x\u00b2\n-3a x\u00b3 -3b x\u00b2 -3c x\n+5a x\u00b2 +5b x +5c\n\nNow, let's collect like terms:\n\n- x\u2074 term: a x\u2074\n- x\u00b3 terms: b x\u00b3 - 3a x\u00b3\n- x\u00b2 terms: c x\u00b2 -3b x\u00b2 +5a x\u00b2\n- x terms: -3c x +5b x\n- constant term: 5c\n\nSo, writing it all together:\n\n= a x\u2074 + (b - 3a) x\u00b3 + (c -3b +5a) x\u00b2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c\n\nNow, we know this is equal to x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. So, to find coefficients, let's set the coefficients equal for each power of x:\n\nFor x\u2074: a = 1\n\nFor x\u00b3: (b - 3a) = -3\n\nFor x\u00b2: (c - 3b +5a) = 0 (since there's no x\u00b2 term on the right side)\n\nFor x: (-3c +5b) = 15\n\nFor constant term: 5c = -25\n\nOkay, so that gives us a system of equations:\n\n1. a = 1\n\n2. b - 3a = -3\n\n3. c - 3b +5a = 0\n\n4. -3c +5b = 15\n\n5. 5c = -25\n\nAlright, let's solve these equations step by step starting from the first equation.\n\nEquation 1: a = 1. So, a is 1. That's straightforward.\n\nMoving to Equation 5: 5c = -25; so, divide both sides by 5, c = -25 / 5 = -5. So, c = -5.\n\nNow that we have a=1 and c=-5, let's plug into Equation 2: Equation 2 says b -3a = -3.\n\nSubstituting a=1, we get: b -3(1) = -3 => b -3 = -3 => b = 0\n\nWait, b = 0?\n\nLet me pause. Let me write down all these steps when plugging in:\n\nEquation 2: b -3a = -3\n\nWith a=1: b - 3(1) = -3 => b -3 = -3 => b = -3 +3 => b=0. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo, b=0. Okay, moving to Equation 3: c -3b +5a = 0.\n\nWe know c=-5, b=0, a=1, so:\n\n-5 -3(0) +5(1) = 0 => -5 +0 +5 = 0 => 0=0. Perfect, it holds.\n\nNow, let's move to Equation 4: -3c +5b = 15.\n\nPlug in c=-5, b=0:\n\n-3(-5)+5(0)=15 =>15 +0=15=>15=15. Also holds.\n\nHmm, so all the equations are consistent. So, we have a=1, b=0, c=-5.\n\nTherefore, the quadratic polynomial p(x)= ax\u00b2 +bx +c=1 x\u00b2 +0x -5 => x\u00b2 - 5.\n\nWait a second. Is that it? So, p(x)=x\u00b2 -5? Hmm. Let me verify.\n\nLet me multiply (x\u00b2 -3x +5) by (x\u00b2 -5) and see if I get the given quartic.\n\nSo, let's do that.\n\n(x\u00b2 -3x +5)(x\u00b2 -5). Let's compute term by term.\n\nFirst, x\u00b2 * x\u00b2 =x\u2074\n\nx\u00b2 * (-5)= -5x\u00b2\n\nThen, -3x *x\u00b2= -3x\u00b3\n\n-3x*(-5)=15x\n\nThen, +5* x\u00b2=5x\u00b2\n\n+5*(-5)= -25\n\nSo, combining all those:\n\nx\u2074 -5x\u00b2 -3x\u00b3 +15x +5x\u00b2 -25\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\nx\u2074 (only term)\n\n-3x\u00b3 (only term)\n\nThen, (-5x\u00b2 +5x\u00b2)=0x\u00b2\n\n15x (only term)\n\n-25 (constant term)\n\nSo, total polynomial is x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Which is exactly the given polynomial on the right-hand side.\n\nWow, that's perfect. So, my values of a=1, b=0, c=-5 result in p(x) = x\u00b2 -5, and this works.\n\nSo, therefore, p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\nWait, maybe I should write p(x)=x\u00b2 -5 to make sure it's correct.\n\nBut let me just double-check my multiplication:\n\n(x\u00b2 -3x +5)(x\u00b2 -5) = x\u2074 -5x\u00b2 -3x\u00b3 +15x +5x\u00b2 -25. The x\u00b2 terms cancel out, and the rest gives x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Yes, that's exactly what we needed. So, seems correct.\n\nSo, like I thought, when we had a=1, b=0, c=-5, everything worked out. So, yeah, p(x) is definitely x\u00b2 -5. I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, maybe I can notice if the polynomials could have been factored or had some factors canceled, but (x\u00b2 -3x +5) is not factorable over the reals, as discriminant is 9 -20 = -11 <0, so it can't be factored into real linear terms.\n\nAlso, the right-hand side, x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Let me see, does that factor? Maybe if we can factor it into (x\u00b2 -3x +5) multiplied by something else, which we just did, but I think it's more work than I need.\n\nGiven that when I multiplied (x\u00b2 -3x +5)*(x\u00b2 -5) I got the exact polynomial on the right, then p(x) must be x\u00b2 -5.\n\nI think that\u2019s solid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is p(x) = x\u00b2 -5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25\\), we assume \\( p(x) \\) is a quadratic polynomial of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\).\n\nExpanding \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c)\\) and combining like terms, we get:\n\\[\na x^4 + (b - 3a) x^3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c\n\\]\n\nWe compare this with the given polynomial \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) and set up the following system of equations by equating the coefficients of corresponding powers of \\( x \\):\n1. \\( a = 1 \\)\n2. \\( b - 3a = -3 \\)\n3. \\( c - 3b + 5a = 0 \\)\n4. \\( -3c + 5b = 15 \\)\n5. \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\nSolving these equations step by step:\n1. From \\( a = 1 \\), we have \\( a = 1 \\).\n2. From \\( 5c = -25 \\), we get \\( c = -5 \\).\n3. Substituting \\( a = 1 \\) into \\( b - 3a = -3 \\), we get \\( b = 0 \\).\n4. Verifying with equations 3 and 4, we find that they hold true with \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), and \\( c = -5 \\).\n\nThus, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is:\n\\[\np(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = x^2 - 5\n\\]\n\nTo verify, we multiply \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)(x^2 - 5)\\) and confirm it results in \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nTherefore, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>"

Hmm, alright, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that an even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in its domain, and an odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). That means, for \\( f \\), swapping the sign of the input doesn't change the output, but for \\( g \\), it flips the sign of the output when the input is negated.\n\nNow, the function in question is \\( f(g(x^3)) \\). I need to determine if this is even, odd, or neither. To check that, I should see if \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\) relates to \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) in a way that fits the definitions.\n\nLet me compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\). First, notice that \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\) because raising a negative to an odd power keeps it negative. So, inside the function \\( g \\), we have \\( g(-x^3) \\).\n\nSince \\( g \\) is an odd function, \\( g(-y) = -g(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). Let me substitute \\( y = x^3 \\), so \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).\n\nNow, substitute this back into the original expression: \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n\nSince \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-z) = f(z) \\) for any \\( z \\). Letting \\( z = g(x^3) \\), it follows that \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nPutting this all together, we have \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), which is \\( f(g(x^3)) \\). This means that the function \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\) satisfies \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), because \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n\nTherefore, by definition, \\( h(x) \\) is an even function.\n\nWait, did I skip any steps? Let me check again.\n\n1. Start with \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n2. Compute \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\).\n3. Simplify the inside: \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\), so \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n4. Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\), so \\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n5. Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n6. That is \\( f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n7. So, \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), which means \\( h \\) is even.\n\nYep, that all checks out. So, whether I cube \\( x \\), apply the odd function \\( g \\), which flips the sign, and then apply the even function \\( f \\), which doesn't care about the sign, results in the overall function being even.\n\nI don't think I made a mistake here. It makes sense because the composition essentially neutralizes the effect of the odd function because of the even function wrapping around it. So, the result is symmetric, hence even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1.

So, let's start by recalling some basic definitions to get a grip on this.\n\nAn even function satisfies the condition \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in its domain. On the other hand, an odd function meets the condition \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in its domain. Okay, so that's clear. Now, in this problem, we\u2019re dealing with compositions of functions, which can sometimes be tricky, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me establish what we know:\n\n1. \\( f(x) \\) is an even function. That means \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\).\n2. \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, so \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n3. We need to analyze the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) and determine if it's even, odd, or neither.\n\nAlright, let's tackle the composition step by step. Let me define a new function \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\) to make things clearer. The question is whether \\( h(-x) \\) equals \\( h(x) \\) (even), \\( -h(x) \\) (odd), or something else.\n\nSo, to figure out what kind of function \\( h(x) \\) is, let's compute \\( h(-x) \\) and see how it relates to \\( h(x) \\). Let's do that step by step.\n\nStart with \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\). Let's simplify the inner part first. \\( (-x)^3 \\) is equal to \\( -x^3 \\), right? Since when you raise a negative number to an odd power, it remains negative. So, \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\). Therefore, the expression becomes:\n\n\\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n\nNow, I remember that \\( g(x) \\) is odd, so substituting \\( -x^3 \\) into \\( g \\) should give us \\( -g(x^3) \\). Let's write that down:\n\n\\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for \\( h(-x) \\):\n\n\\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n\nHmm, so we have \\( f(-g(x^3)) \\) now. Here, \\( f(x) \\) is even. What happens when we plug in \\( -g(x^3) \\) into an even function?\n\nSince \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). So, if we let \\( y = g(x^3) \\), then:\n\n\\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nBut wait, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is exactly our original function \\( h(x) \\). So, substituting that back:\n\n\\( h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n\nSo, \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), which per the definitions, means that \\( h(x) \\) is even.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any steps or assumptions. Let's go step by step again.\n\n1. \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n2. To find if \\( h(-x) \\) equals \\( h(x) \\) or \\( -h(x) \\), compute \\( h(-x) \\):\n   - \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n3. Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\):\n   - \\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n4. Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n5. Thus, \\( h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n\nYes, everything checks out. So, each step holds. So, the composition \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\nWait another thought\u2014is the composition of an even and an odd function necessarily even or could it vary? Let's think.\n\nSuppose \\( f \\) is even and \\( g \\) is odd. Then, when you compose them, the inside function is odd (\\( g(x^3) \\). But since \\( x^3 \\) is also an odd function (because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\)), composing an odd function \\( g \\) with another odd function \\( x^3 \\) gives us \\( g(x^3) \\) as odd?\n\nWait, hold on: is \\( g(x^3) \\) even, odd, or neither?\n\nIf \\( g \\) is odd, then \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). So, let's compute \\( g((-x)^3) = g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\), because \\( g \\) is odd. So, \\( g(x^3) \\) is an odd function, because \\( g((-x)^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, the inner function \\( g(x^3) \\) is odd.\n\nSo, now, \\( f \\) maps this intermediate odd function. So, \\( h(x) = f \\) (something odd). Since \\( f \\) is even, how does it interact with an odd input?\n\nLet's note that even functions take care of the sign, so \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\). Therefore, no matter if the input to \\( f \\) is odd or not, \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\). So, even when the input is odd, you still get the same value as when you input the positive version.\n\nSo, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), leading to \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), as established before.\n\nBut hold on, let me consider specific examples to verify my conclusion because sometimes these properties can be counter-intuitive.\n\nSuppose \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\), which is odd. Then, computing \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\), which is \\( (x^3)^2 = x^6 \\). Is \\( x^6 \\) even? Yes, because any even power of \\( x \\) is an even function.\n\nAlternatively, take another even function, say \\( f(x) = \\cos(x) \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = \\sin(x) \\), which is odd. Then, \\( h(x) = \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\). Then, \\( h(-x) = \\cos(\\sin((-x)^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(-x^3)) = \\cos(-\\sin(x^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\), because cosine is an even function. Therefore, \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so it is even as well.\n\nBut wait, let me think if I can get an example where the composition is neither even nor odd. Let me see.\n\nSuppose \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x + x^3 \\). Is \\( g(x) \\) odd? Let's check \\( g(-x) = (-x) + (-x)^3 = -x - x^3 = - (x + x^3) = -g(x) \\), so yes, \\( g \\) is odd.\n\nThen \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) = (g(x^3))^2 = (x^3 + (x^3)^3)^2 = (x^3 + x^9)^2 \\). Let me test \\( h(-x) = (-x^3 + (-x^9))^2 = (-x^3 - x^9)^2 = (x^3 + x^9)^2 = h(x) \\). So, still, it's even. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need a different example where maybe \\( f \\) isn't just a power function. Let me take \\( f(x) = |x| \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\), which is odd. Then, \\( h(x) = |x^3| \\). Now, \\( |(-x)^3| = | -x^3 | = |x^3| \\), so \\( h(-x) = |x^3| = h(x) \\), which is still even.\n\nIs there a scenario where the composition would be odd?\n\nWait, for \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) to be odd, we need \\( f(g(-x^3)) = -f(g(x^3)) \\), but since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), so for the antipodal condition to hold, \\( f(g(-x^3)) = -f(g(x^3)) \\) meaning \\( f(-g(x^3)) = -f(g(x^3)) \\), which would only require that \\( f(-y) = -f(y) \\) for \\( y = g(x^3) \\), but since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\). Therefore, unless \\( f(y) \\) is also odd for all \\( y \\), the equality may not hold. But \\( f \\) is given as even, not odd.\n\nTherefore, in general, unless \\( f \\) is both even and odd, which is only possible if it's the zero function, it's impossible for the composition to be odd because \\( f \\) being even forces \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), making \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), hence even.\n\nTherefore, my earlier conclusion seems solid.\n\nSo, summarizing the steps:\n\n- Start with \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n- Compute \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n- Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).\n- Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n- Therefore, \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so \\( h(x) \\) is even.\n\nI think that checks out. I considered some specific examples, and in each case, the composition came out even. I also stepped through the general case again without seeing any contradictions, which supports my conclusion.\n\nSo, to wrap it up, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is an even function.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) ) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1. An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\).\n2. An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\nTo analyze the composition \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\), we compute \\( h(-x) \\):\n\n\\[\nh(-x) = f(g((-x)^3))\n\\]\n\nSince \\((-x)^3 = -x^3\\), we have:\n\n\\[\nh(-x) = f(g(-x^3))\n\\]\n\nBecause \\( g \\) is an odd function:\n\n\\[\ng(-x^3) = -g(x^3)\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\nh(-x) = f(-g(x^3))\n\\]\n\nSince \\( f \\) is an even function:\n\n\\[\nf(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3))\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\nh(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x)\n\\]\n\nThis shows that \\( h(x) \\) is even.

To do that, I should check the definition of even and odd for composite functions. That is, I should find \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\) and compare it to \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) and see if it equals either \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) or \\( -f(g(x^3)) \\), or neither.\n\nLet's compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\).\n\nFirst, calculate \\( (-x)^3 \\). That's \\( -x^3 \\). So, we have \\( g(-x^3) \\).\n\nBut since \\( g \\) is an odd function, \\( g(-y) = -g(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). Let me substitute \\( y = x^3 \\) here. So, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, \\( f(g(-x^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n\nNow, since \\( f \\) is an even function, \\( f(-z) = f(z) \\) for any \\( z \\). Let me denote \\( z = g(x^3) \\), then \\( f(-z) = f(z) \\).\n\nSo, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). Putting it all together, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). Therefore, the function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) satisfies \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), which is the definition of an even function.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I started by evaluating \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\), which breaks down to \\( f(-g(x^3)) \\) because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\) and \\( g \\) is odd. Then, since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). So the composition is even. Hmm, seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can test it with specific examples to make sure.\n\nLet's take \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) (which is even) and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\) (which is odd). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = (x^3)^2 = x^6 \\). Is \\( x^6 \\) even or odd? Well, substituting \\( -x \\) gives \\( (-x)^6 = x^6 \\), so yes, it's even. So in this case, it's even.\n\nAnother example: Let \\( f(x) = \\cos(x) \\) (which is even) and \\( g(x) = \\sin(x) \\) (which is odd). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\). Let's check if this is even or odd. Compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = \\cos(\\sin((-x)^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(-x^3)) \\). Since \\( \\sin(-x^3) = -\\sin(x^3) \\) (because sine is odd), then \\( \\cos(-\\sin(x^3)) \\). Cosine is an even function, so \\( \\cos(-a) = \\cos(a) \\), so this becomes \\( \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\). Therefore, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), so this composite function is also even. Interesting.\n\nWait, is that always the case, regardless of the specific even and odd functions? Let me test another example. Maybe with \\( f(x) = x^4 \\) (even) and \\( g(x) = x^5 \\) (odd). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = (x^5)^4 = x^{20} \\), which is even because \\( (-x)^{20} = x^{20} \\). Seems okay.\n\nPerhaps an even function that's not just a power, and an odd function that isn't a power. Let's see, \\( f(x) = e^{x^2} \\) (which is even since \\( e^{(-x)^2} = e^{x^2} \\)) and \\( g(x) = \\sin(x) \\) (which is odd). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = e^{(\\sin(x^3))^2} \\). Let's check if this is even: Replace \\( x \\) with \\( -x \\) and see if equality holds.\n\n\\( f(g((-x)^3)) = e^{(\\sin((-x)^3))^2} = e^{(\\sin(-x^3))^2} \\). Since sine is odd, \\( \\sin(-x^3) = -\\sin(x^3) \\). So squaring it, \\( (-\\sin(x^3))^2 = (\\sin(x^3))^2 \\). Therefore, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = e^{(\\sin(x^3))^2} = f(g(x^3)) \\). So again it's even.\n\nHmm, seems that across the board it's even.\n\nAlternatively, let me try if \\( g(x) \\) isn't odd but even, just for testing. Wait, but in this problem, \\( g \\) is odd. So if I wouldn't get the right result? Anyway, in our problem \\( g \\) is odd, so that's consistent.\n\nLet me try another example where \\( f \\) is even, but \\( g \\) is different. Say \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), \\( g(x) = x^3 + x \\), which is odd because \\( g(-x) = -x^3 -x = -(x^3 + x) = -g(x) \\). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = (x^3 + x)^2 = x^6 + 2x^4 + x^2 \\). Test whether this is even: substitute \\( -x \\): \\( (-x)^6 + 2(-x)^4 + (-x)^2 = x^6 + 2x^4 + x^2 \\), which is the same as before. So yes, it's even.\n\nAlternatively, take a non-algebraic even function. Suppose \\( f(x) = |x| \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\), which is odd. Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = |g(x^3)| = |x^9| = |x|^9 \\). Wait, is that even or odd?\n\n\\( |x^9| = |x|^9 \\). Then evaluating at \\( -x \\): \\( |(-x)^9| = | -x^9 | = |x|^9 \\). So they are equal, so \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even again.\n\nWait, so in all these examples, it's even. So is there a reason why? Let's see:\n\n1. Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\n2. Then \\( g(x^3) \\) as is: for any \\( x \\), \\( g(x^3) \\) is... wait, it's not straightforwardly odd or even because \\( x^3 \\) is odd.\n\nWait, but if \\( g \\) is odd, then \\( g(x^3) \\) is still a function, right? Let me check if \\( g(x^3) \\) is even or odd. Let's consider \\( h(x) = g(x^3) \\). Is \\( h(-x) = -h(x) \\) or \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\)?\n\nCompute \\( h(-x) = g((-x)^3) = g(-x^3) \\). But since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). So \\( h(-x) = -g(x^3) = -h(x) \\). Therefore, \\( h(x) = g(x^3) \\) is an odd function.\n\nSo in reality, after the substitution, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) becomes \\( f(h(x)) \\) where \\( h(x) \\) is odd.\n\nNow, since \\( f \\) is even, what happens when we plug an odd function into an even function? Let me recall:\n\nIf \\( h(x) \\) is odd, \\( h(-x) = -h(x) \\). So \\( f(h(-x)) = f(-h(x)) \\). Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-h(x)) = f(h(x)) \\). Therefore, \\( f(h(-x)) = f(h(x)) \\), which means \\( f \\circ h \\) is even, because \\( (f \\circ h)(-x) = (f \\circ h)(x) \\).\n\nTherefore, yes, the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it:\n\nLet me denote \\( y = x^3 \\). Then \\( f(g(y)) \\). Since \\( y = x^3 \\), which has a power of 3. So if I replace \\( x \\) with \\( -x \\), \\( y \\) becomes \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\). So then \\( f(g(-x^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\) because \\( g \\) is odd. And since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). Hence, \\( f(g(x^3)) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\), so the function is even.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the specific even and odd functions chosen, as long as \\( f \\) is even and \\( g \\) is odd, the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) ends up being even.\n\nIs there a situation when this might not hold? Maybe if \\( f \\) or \\( g \\) are not injective or something? Hmm, but the property doesn't depend on injectivity or surjectivity because it's based solely on the functional equations \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) and \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). So since these properties hold for all \\( x \\), regardless of specific behavior, then the composition will always satisfy \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\) making it even.\n\nTherefore, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is an even function.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1. **Properties of Even and Odd Functions**:\n   - An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\).\n   - An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the Composite Function**:\n   - We need to check if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even or odd.\n   - Consider \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\).

I have this math problem here: If f(x) is an even function and g(x) is an odd function, find if f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, odd, or neither. Hmm, I remember that even and odd functions have specific properties, so maybe I can use those to figure it out.\n\nFirst off, let's recall what even and odd functions are. An even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain. So, if I plug in -x, it's the same as plugging in x. Classic examples are functions like f(x) = x\u00b2 or cosine functions.\n\nOn the other hand, an odd function satisfies g(-x) = -g(x). So, flipping the sign of x flips the sign of the output. Examples include g(x) = x\u00b3 or sine functions.\n\nAlright, so in this problem, f is even, g is odd. I need to compute whether the composition f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, odd, or neither. Let me think through the composition step by step.\n\nLet me denote h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)). So, h(x) is the composition of f(g(x\u00b3)). To determine if h(x) is even, odd, or neither, I should check h(-x).\n\nLet me compute h(-x):\n\nh(-x) = f(g((-x)\u00b3)).\n\nFirst, let's process inner function g. Since -x is raised to the 3rd power, (-x)\u00b3 = -x\u00b3. So, the argument becomes -x\u00b3. Then, since g is odd, g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). So, substituting back into h(-x), we have:\n\nh(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n\nNow, since f is even, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)). Let me note that down.\n\nTherefore, h(-x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = h(x). \n\nWait, so h(-x) = h(x). That means h(x) is even because it satisfies the definition of an even function, right? Because plugging in -x doesn't change the value of h(x).\n\nLet me double-check that step:\n\n1. Start with h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n2. To find if it's even or odd, evaluate h(-x).\n3. Compute g(-x\u00b3). Since g is odd, g(-y) = -g(y). So, let y = x\u00b3, then g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3).\n4. Thus, h(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n5. Since f is even, f(-z) = f(z) for any z. Therefore, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n6. Thus, h(-x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = h(x).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, h(-x) = h(x), which is exactly the condition for h(x) being even. Therefore, f(g(x\u00b3)) is an even function.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any steps or misapply the properties. Hmm.\n\nAnother way to think about it: suppose f(x) is even, so f(-y) = f(y). g is odd, so g(-z) = -g(z). So, plugging into h(-x):\n\nh(-x) = f(g((-x)\u00b3)) = f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-g(x\u00b3)) because g is odd. Then, using f is even, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = h(x). So yes, h(-x) = h(x), so h is even.\n\nAlternatively, I can use substitutions:\n\nLet\u2019s consider substituting x with -x in h(x):\n\nh(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(-x^3)) because (-x)^3 is -x^3.\n\nSince g is odd, g(-x^3) = -g(x^3). Plugging that in, h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)).\n\nBut f is even, so f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)).\n\nBut f(g(x^3)) is exactly h(x). So, h(-x) = h(x), so h is even.\n\nTherefore, regardless of specific functions f and g, as long as f is even and g is odd, the composition f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nLet me test with actual functions to verify.\n\nSuppose f(x) = x\u00b2 (which is even) and g(x) = x\u00b3 (which is odd). Then h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = (x\u00b3)^3 = x^9.\n\nWait, is x^9 even or odd? Well, x^9 is an odd function because (-x)^9 = -x^9. So, wait, h(x) = x^9 is odd, which contradicts our earlier conclusion that it's even.\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem right. Did I make an error somewhere?\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me compute h(x) in this case.\n\nf(x) = x\u00b2, g(x) = x\u00b3.\n\nThen h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = f((x\u00b3)^3) = f(x^9) = (x^9)^2 = x^18.\n\nAh, that's even because (-x)^18 = x^18. So h(-x) = (-x)^18 = x^18 = h(x). So, in this case, h(x) is even.\n\nBut earlier, I thought h(x) = x^9, which is odd, but actually, wait, no:\n\nNo, because in the composition f(g(x\u00b3)), with f(x) = x\u00b2, which is even, and g(x\u00b3) is x^9, which is an odd function. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) is (x^9)\u00b2 = x^{18}. So, yes, it's even.\n\nWait, but if I had g(x) = x\u00b3, f(x) = x, then h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = x\u00b3, which is odd. Hmm, but in that case, f is neither even nor odd necessarily? Wait, no.\n\nWait, is f(x) = x considered even or odd? f(-x) = -x = -f(x), so yes, f(x) = x is odd. So in that example, f is odd, right.\n\nBut in our original problem, f is even. So, in my first example, with f being x\u00b2 and g being x\u00b3: f is even, g is odd. So then, h is f(g(x\u00b3)) is x^18, which is even. So that works.\n\nBut wait, if f is the identity function, which is odd, and g is odd, then f(g(x\u00b3)) would be g(x\u00b3), which, if g is odd, would make it odd cubed, which is also odd. So, we can clearly see that the composition's parity depends on the functions involved.\n\nWait, but in our problem, f is even, g is odd.\n\nWait, let me take another example to check.\n\nSuppose f(x) = x^4, which is even. g(x) = x^5, which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) would be (x^5)^3)^4? Wait, no. Wait, no, wait, g(x\u00b3) is x\u00b3^5? Wait, no: Hold on, no. If g(x) = x^5, then g(x\u00b3) = (x\u00b3)^5 = x^{15}.\n\nThen, f(g(x\u00b3)) = f(x^{15}) = (x^{15})^4 = x^{60}. Which is even, because (-x)^60 = x^60. So yes, h(x) = x^{60} is even.\n\nAlternatively, if I took g(x) = x (odd) and f(x) = x\u00b2 (even). Then f(g(x\u00b3)) is (g(x\u00b3))^2 = (x\u00b3)^2 = x^6, which is even. So that works too.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake before when thinking of f(x) = x being odd, but in the problem, f is specifically even. So, in that case, if I have f(x) = x, which is odd, but in our problem, f is even, so we have to use f preserving the symmetry, making the composition even.\n\nAlternatively, what if f is a constant function? Like f(x) = 2, which is even? Wait, f(-x) = 2 = f(x), so yes, constant function is even. Then g(x) is odd, say g(x) = x\u00b3. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) = f(x^9) = 2, which is even because h(-x) = 2 = h(x). So yeah, that still holds.\n\nOkay, so testing multiple cases, and in all of them, f(g(x\u00b3)) is even when f is even and g is odd. So, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, I think the conclusion is that h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) is even under the given conditions.\n\nWait, but just to ensure, what if f is even, g is odd, but, say, f is even like x\u00b2, and g is odd like x, so f(g(x\u00b3)) = (x\u00b3)^2 = x^6, which is even. Alternatively, if g was an odd function but not x\u00b3, say, sin(x). Then f(g(x\u00b3)) = (sin(x\u00b3))\u00b2, which is still even because [sin(-x\u00b3)]\u00b2 = [ - sin(x\u00b3) ]\u00b2 = [sin(x\u00b3)]\u00b2, which is equal to (sin(x\u00b3))\u00b2. So, yeah, squaring it would make it even regardless. That also makes sense because f is even, so whatever comes out of g is squared.\n\nSo, seems solid.\n\nAnother angle: If f is even, then f(-y) = f(y). So, for h(x), h(-x) = f(g(-x\u00b3)).\n\nSince g is odd, g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3).\n\nTherefore:\n\nh(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n\nBecause f is even, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nWhich is h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nTherefore, h(-x) = h(x), which is the definition of even.\n\nYep, so that's consistent.\n\nSo, mathematically, no mistake in the reasoning.\n\nPerhaps my initial confusion came when choosing a function g for h(x) = g(x\u00b3), but when f is not necessarily even, but f is applied to g(x\u00b3), then the behavior is different. But in our problem, f is even, so f(g(x\u00b3)) ends up being even.\n\nHence, I feel confident the answer is even.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\nFirst, recall the definitions:\n- An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n- An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\nTo determine the nature of \\( f(g(x^3)) \\), we evaluate it at \\( -x \\):\n\n1.

Recognize that \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is the original function \\( h(x) \\):\n   \\[\n   h(-x) = h(x)\n   \\]\n\nThus, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) satisfies the condition for being an even function. Therefore, the function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>",

Hmm. Let's see. First, I remember that an even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x, and an odd function satisfies f(-x) = -f(x) for all x.\n\nWait, in this case, f(x) is even and g(x) is odd. So I need to see what happens when I compose these functions with x\u00b3 inside. Let me think step by step.\n\nLet me denote h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)). To determine if h(x) is even, odd, or neither, I should check h(-x) and see how it relates to h(x).\n\nSo, h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)). Let me compute (-x)^3 first. Since (-x)^3 = -x\u00b3, that simplifies to -x\u00b3. So h(-x) becomes f(g(-x\u00b3)).\n\nBut since g is an odd function, g(-y) = -g(y) for any y. Let me let y = x\u00b3, then g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). So substituting back, we have h(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n\nNow, f is an even function, so f(-z) = f(z) for any z. Let me set z = g(x\u00b3), so f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)). Therefore, h(-x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = h(x).\n\nSince h(-x) = h(x), that means h(x) is an even function. So f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nWait, let me go over that again to make sure I didn't skip a step. So f is even, so applying f to something negative is the same as applying f to the positive version. Therefore, h(-x) becomes f of g(-x\u00b3) which is f(g(-x\u00b3)). Since g is odd, g(-x\u00b3) is -g(x\u00b3). So h(-x) becomes f(-g(x\u00b3)). Since f is even, that's the same as f(g(x\u00b3)) which is h(x). So yes, h(-x) = h(x). Therefore, h(x) is even.\n\nHmm, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. Let me double-check with an example maybe? Maybe pick specific f and g functions and test.\n\nSuppose f(x) = x\u00b2, which is even. Let g(x) = x\u00b3 - x, which is an odd function since g(-x) = (-x)^3 - (-x) = -x\u00b3 + x = -(x\u00b3 - x) = -g(x). So f(g(x\u00b3)) would be (g(x\u00b3))\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute g(x\u00b3): g(x\u00b3) = (x\u00b3)^3 - x\u00b3 = x^9 - x\u00b3. Then h(x) = (x^9 - x\u00b3)^2. Let's see what h(-x) is: h(-x) = ((-x)^9 - (-x)^3)^2 = (-x^9 + x^3)^2 = (x^3 - x^9)^2, which is the same as (x^9 - x^3)^2. So h(-x) = h(x). Yep, so that's even.\n\nAnother example: Let\u2019s pick f(x) = cos(x), which is even, and g(x) = sin(x), which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) is cos(sin(x\u00b3)). Now, let's check if this is even. \n\nh(-x) = cos(sin((-x)^3)) = cos(sin(-x\u00b3)) = cos(-sin(x\u00b3)) because sin is odd. But cos is even, so cos(-sin(x\u00b3)) = cos(sin(x\u00b3)) = h(x). So again, h(-x) = h(x). Therefore, even.\n\nWait, what if f is even but g is not necessarily linear? Let's try another one. Let f(x) = e^x + e^{-x}, which is also even. Because f(-x) = e^{-x} + e^{x} = f(x). Let\u2019s let g(x) = x^3, which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) = e^{g(x\u00b3)} + e^{-g(x\u00b3)} = e^{x^9} + e^{-x^9}. Now test h(-x). h(-x) = e^{(-x)^9} + e^{-(-x)^9} = e^{-x^9} + e^{x^9}, which is the same as h(x). So still even.\n\nWait, let me try with an f that's even, and g that's odd but not linear. Let\u2019s take f(x) = |x|, since it's even. Let g(x) be any odd function, say, g(x) = x^5 - x, which is odd.\n\nThen f(g(x\u00b3)) is |g(x\u00b3)| = |x^15 - x\u00b3|. Now, let's find h(-x) = |g((-x)^3)| = |g(-x\u00b3)| = | -g(x\u00b3) | = | - (x^15 - x\u00b3) | = |x^15 - x\u00b3| because absolute value of negative is positive. So again, h(-x) = h(x). Even.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Let me think if there's a case where it's not even.\n\nWait, suppose f is even, say f(x) = x^4 which is even, and g(x) = x^3 - x^5, which is still odd. Hmm, then g(x\u00b3) is (x\u00b3)^3 - (x\u00b3)^5 = x^9 - x^{15}, so h(x) = (x^9 - x^{15})^4. Then h(-x) = ((-x)^9 - (-x)^{15})^4. But since -x^9 = -x^9 and -x^{15} = -x^{15}. So (-x^9 - (-x^{15})) = -x^9 + x^{15}. Then h(-x) is (-x^9 + x^{15})^4.\n\nBut (-x^9 + x^{15}) is equal to -(x^9 - x^{15}), and raising it to the 4th power: (-1)^4*(x^9 - x^{15})^4 = (x^9 - x^{15})^4, same as h(x). So h(-x)=h(x). Thus even.\n\nAnother scenario: suppose f is even, g is odd, so f(g(x\u00b3)). So plugging in -x into x\u00b3 gives -x\u00b3, which, because g is odd, gives -g(x\u00b3). And since f is even, f(-g(x\u00b3))=f(g(x\u00b3))=h(x). So algebraically, yes, it's even. \n\nWait, is there any case where this wouldn't hold? Maybe if the functions are more complicated? Suppose f is even, g is odd, and f(g(x\u00b3)) is a constant function, which is also even or odd? Wait, let's say f is the constant function. Suppose f(x)=1, which is even. Let g(x)=x, which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3))=1, which is even. So in that case, it's even. Alternatively, f(x)=0 is even, g(x)=0, which is even\u2014wait, is zero function considered both even and odd? Wait, actually, the zero function is both even and odd since f(-x)=f(x) and f(-x)=-f(x). So in that trivial case, it's both.\n\nBut regardless, if h(x) is both even and odd, it's actually the zero function. But in the above problem, f is even, g is odd, so f(g(x\u00b3)) would have to be... Wait, except for the zero function, other cases?\n\nWait, if g(x\u00b3) is such that g(x\u00b3) is a constant function? Hmm, like if g(x) is a constant. Let me say g(x)=k, which is a constant. Then since g is a constant, which is also even because g(-x)=k=-k? No, wait, g(x)=k implies that it's even if k= -k, which implies k=0. So if g is a constant function, it's a constant zero function, because otherwise, if it's a non-zero constant, g(-x)=g(x) as it's a constant, but for oddity, g(-x)=-g(x), which would require k = -k, meaning k must be zero.\n\nSo in that case, if g was a constant non-zero, it can't be odd. So g must be zero function. Then f(g(x\u00b3))=f(0). If f is even, f(0) is a constant. So the result is a constant, which as I said, is both even and odd.\n\nBut in that case, is that different from just being even? Well, if it is a constant function, it's both. So, in terms of whether it's considered even or just even? Since only even and odd functions are usually defined up to sign, but as per problem statement, we can say it's even because it satisfies the condition without violating being odd. Wait, but if a function is both even and odd, it's the zero function. So if f(x)=0, then h(x)=0 is both, but in this case, if g(x)=0, then h(x)=f(0), which is a constant. So if f(0) is non-zero, h(x)=c, which is both even and odd only if c=0.\n\nBut in any case, regardless of that specific case, since in the earlier steps we showed that h(-x)=h(x), which is sufficient for being even. It might also be odd if h(x)=0, but in that case, only the zero function is both. Otherwise, h(x) would just be even.\n\nSo, when dealing with h(x)=f(g(x\u00b3)), since g is odd, the composition flips the sign, but f, being even, negates it back, leading h(x) to be even. Alternatively, all the steps algebraically lead to h(-x)=h(x). So I think it's safe to conclude that f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nI think my thought process is solid here. So, the answer must be even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nTo determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither, we start by noting that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function. \n\nA function \\( h(x) \\) is even if \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\) for all \\( x \\), and it is odd if \\( h(-x) = -h(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\nLet \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).

It tells me that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function. Hmm, okay, let me recall some properties of even and odd functions.\n\nAn even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\), right? So, if I plug in \\(-x\\), it's the same as plugging in \\( x \\). Classic examples are like \\( x^2 \\) or cosine functions. On the other hand, an odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). These functions are symmetric about the origin. Examples include \\( x^3 \\) or sine functions.\n\nSo, the problem is about composing functions here: \\( f(g(x^3)) \\). Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that \\( x^3 \\) is an odd function because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\). So, \\( g(x^3) \\) would be \\( g(\\text{something odd}) \\). But wait, \\( g \\) is an odd function, so does that mean \\( g(x^3) \\) is odd?\n\nLet me test it: if I plug in \\(-x\\) into \\( g(x^3) \\), it becomes \\( g((-x)^3) = g(-x^3) \\). Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, \\( g(x^3) \\) is indeed an odd function because \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).\n\nSo, now we have \\( g(x^3) \\) as an odd function. The next step is applying \\( f \\) to it. \\( f \\) is even, so \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). Let me set \\( y = g(x^3) \\). Then, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\) because \\( f \\) is even.\n\nNow, to check if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even or odd, I need to evaluate it at \\( -x \\) and see what happens. Let's compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\).\n\nFirst, \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\), so inside the function, we have \\( g(-x^3) \\). But as established earlier, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n\nSince \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). So, replacing \\( x \\) with \\( -x \\) in \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) doesn't change the value; that is, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). \n\nBy the definition of even functions, if \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), then \\( h(x) \\) is even. So here, \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\), and plugging in \\( -x \\) doesn't change the value. That suggests that \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is indeed an even function.\n\nWait, let me make sure there are no mistakes here. What if the composition is more complex? Hmm, let's try a concrete example.\n\nSuppose \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\), which is odd. Then, \\( f(g(x^3)) = (x^3)^2 = x^6 \\). Now, is \\( x^6 \\) even? Yes, because \\( (-x)^6 = x^6 \\). That works.\n\nLet me try another example. Let \\( f(x) = \\cos(x) \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = \\sin(x) \\), which is odd. Then, \\( g(x^3) = \\sin(x^3) \\). Applying \\( f \\), we get \\( \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\). Hmmm, is this function even or odd?\n\nLet's test \\( \\cos(\\sin((-x)^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(-x^3)) \\). Since sine is odd, \\( \\sin(-x^3) = -\\sin(x^3) \\), so \\( \\cos(-\\sin(x^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\) because cosine is even. So, indeed, the composition remains the same when replacing \\( x \\) with \\( -x \\), which means it's even. That seems to back up my earlier conclusion.\n\nIs there a case where it might not be even? Suppose \\( f \\) is a constant function, which is trivially even. Then \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is just a constant, which is even. If \\( f \\) is something else, like \\( f(x) = |x| \\), which is also even, then composing with any odd function inside would still give an even function because \\( |g(x^3)| \\) is the same as \\( |g(-x^3)| \\) since both \\( x^3 \\) and \\( -x^3 \\) are mapped to their absolute values by \\( f \\).\n\nSo, it seems consistent. Each example I test is confirming that the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even when \\( f \\) is even and \\( g \\) is odd. I don't see a scenario where it could be odd. Since both functions have specific symmetries, the result inherits the symmetry from \\( f \\).\n\nWait, but why does it not become odd? Suppose \\( f \\) was odd instead, but in our case, it's even. So, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is made by an even function composed with an odd function inside another odd function. That seems like it would preserve some symmetry but not necessarily switch it.\n\nWait, perhaps another angle: if \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\), and then \\( f(g(-x)) = f(-g(x)) \\). But since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x)) = f(g(x)) \\). So, \\( f(g(-x)) = f(g(x)) \\), which means \\( f(g(x)) \\) is even.\n\nTherefore, in our case, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even because \\( f(g(-x^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nYes, that seems to solidify the conclusion. So, applying \\( f \\) after an odd function preserves the evenness because of how even functions treat negatives inside.\n\nSo, to recap, since \\( g(x^3) \\) is odd, when you apply an even function \\( f \\) to it, the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) becomes even. Therefore, the answer should be that \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is an even function.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1. An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n2. An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n3. The function \\( x^3 \\) is an odd function because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\).\n\nFirst, we evaluate \\( g(x^3) \\):\n- Since \\( g \\) is an odd function, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, \\( g(x^3) \\) is an odd function.\n\nNext, we apply the even function \\( f \\) to \\( g(x^3) \\):\n- Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). Let \\( y = g(x^3) \\).

        "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c><\uff5cUser\uff5c>Please solve the following mathematical problem, placing your final answer within \\boxed{}:\nIf $f(x)$ is an even function and $g(x)$ is an odd function, find if $f(g(x^3))$ is even, odd, or neither.\n\nEnter \"odd\", \"even\", or \"neither\".<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, we have two functions here: f(x) is even, and g(x) is odd. The question is asking about the nature of another function, f(g(x\u00b3)). Is it even, odd, or neither?\n\nOkay, let me recall my function properties. Even functions satisfy the condition f(-x) = f(x), right? So, for example, f(x) = x\u00b2 is even because (-x)\u00b2 = x\u00b2. On the other hand, odd functions satisfy g(-x) = -g(x), like g(x) = x\u00b3 because (-x)\u00b3 = -x\u00b3.\n\nSo, we're dealing with f(g(x\u00b3)). Let me break this down step by step. First, I can think of the operations as a composition of functions. So, starting from the innermost function, we have x\u00b3, then we apply g to that, and finally f to the result.\n\nGiven that, let's try to test whether f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, odd, or neither. The standard method is to compute f(g((-x)\u00b3)) and see how it relates to f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n1. Compute (-x)\u00b3: that's -x\u00b3. Okay, that negative sign is important.\n2. Then apply g to that result: g(-x\u00b3). But since g is an odd function, g(-a) = -g(a) for any a. So, g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3).\n3. Now, we plug that into f: f(-g(x\u00b3)). So, we have f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n\nBut wait, f is an even function. Even functions satisfy f(-y) = f(y) for any y. So, if we let y = g(x\u00b3), then f(-y) = f(y). Therefore, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nPutting it all together: f(g((-x)\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)). \n\nThis means that when we substitute -x into the function f(g(x\u00b3)), we just get the same value as f(g(x\u00b3)). Which by definition of even functions is exactly what even means.\n\nSo, it seems that f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nBut hold on, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It often helps to test with specific examples for f and g that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nLet's choose f(x) as an even function. The simplest example is f(x) = x\u00b2.\n\nLet's pick g(x) as an odd function. Again, the simplest example is g(x) = x\u00b3.\n\nNow, let's compute f(g(x\u00b3)). Let's see:\n\n- First, compute x\u00b3. Then, apply g to that: g(x\u00b3) = (x\u00b3)\u00b3 = x\u2079.\n- Then, apply f to x\u2079: f(x\u2079) = (x\u2079)\u00b2 = x\u00b9\u2078.\n\nSo, f(g(x\u00b3)) = x\u00b9\u2078.\n\nNow, is x\u00b9\u2078 an even function? Well, yes, because if we replace x with -x, we have (-x)\u00b9\u2078 = x\u00b9\u2078, which is the same as the original function.\n\nSo, in this specific example, f(g(x\u00b3)) is indeed an even function.\n\nLet me try another example to make sure my reasoning isn't flawed.\n\nLet me choose a different even function, say f(x) = cos(x), which is even since cos(-x) = cos(x).\n\nAnd another odd function, say g(x) = x.\n\nSo, f(g(x\u00b3)) becomes f(x\u00b3) = cos(x\u00b3).\n\nIs cos(x\u00b3) even? Yes, because cos(-x\u00b3)=cos(x\u00b3). So, it maintains the evenness.\n\nAnother example: f(x) = |x|, which is even, and g(x) = sin(x), which is odd.\n\nThen, f(g(x\u00b3)) = |g(x\u00b3)| = |sin(x\u00b3)|. Is this even? Let's see: |sin(-x\u00b3)| = | - sin(x\u00b3) | = |sin(x\u00b3)|, so yes, it is even.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Maybe I should try a non-monotonic example.\n\nLet\u2019s take f(x) = x\u00b2 + 1, which is still even, and g(x) = x\u00b3 - x, which is odd because g(-x) = (-x)\u00b3 - (-x) = -x\u00b3 + x = - (x\u00b3 - x) = -g(x).\n\nThen, f(g(x\u00b3)) would be [g(x\u00b3)]\u00b2 + 1 = [ (x\u00b3)\u00b3 - (x\u00b3) ]\u00b2 + 1 = (x\u2079 - x\u00b3)\u00b2 + 1.\n\nExpanding this, we get (x\u00b9\u2078 - 2x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u2076) + 1. Is this even? Yes, since all the exponents are even numbers. So replacing x with -x would yield the same result: [ (-x)\u2079 - (-x)\u00b3 ]\u00b2 + 1 = (-x\u2079 + x\u00b3)\u00b2 + 1 = (x\u2079 - x\u00b3)\u00b2 + 1, which is the same as the original.\n\nSo, again, it's even. Hmm, interesting. Maybe this is a consistent result.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me try a function where perhaps f(g(x\u00b3)) could have different behavior.\n\nSuppose f(x) is even, but not as straightforward, like f(x) = e^(-x\u00b2), which is even since it's symmetric around the y-axis. And then g(x) is odd, say g(x) = x. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) = e^(-x\u2076). Which is still even because exponentials of even powers remain even.\n\nHold on, let me see if I can manage a contrived example where f(g(x\u00b3)) isn't even. Maybe f(x) is even, but somehow g doesn't preserve the signature. But given that g is odd, g(-x) = -g(x), which would inherently create symmetry that when squared or composed within f, which is even, might nullify any asymmetry.\n\nThinking in terms of composition, if you have an even function applied on an odd function, then inside you have an odd function, then applied to an even function, overall what is the result? Wait, perhaps we can think about it as f(g(x)).\n\nBut in our case, it's f(g(x\u00b3)). So, perhaps let\u2019s dissect that:\n\nFirst, x\u00b3 is an odd function, because if you flip x to -x, it becomes -x\u00b3. Then, applying g, which is itself an odd function, so g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). Then, applying f, which is even, so f(-g(x\u00b3))=f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nSo, in other words, f(g(-x\u00b3))=f(g(x\u00b3)) which is exactly the condition for f(g(x\u00b3)) being even.\n\nTherefore, it does hold.\n\nThus, yes, f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nI think that seems consistent across multiple examples. So, I can conclude that f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1. **Understanding the properties**:\n   - An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\).\n   - An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\n2. **Testing the composition**:\n   - Compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\).\n   - Simplify \\( (-x)^3 \\) to \\( -x^3 \\).\n   - Apply \\( g \\) to \\( -x^3 \\).

Let me recall some definitions first. An even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain, and an odd function satisfies f(-x) = -f(x) for all x. \n\nGiven that f(x) is even, so f(-y) = f(y) for any y. And g(x) is odd, so g(-y) = -g(y). Now, I need to determine the nature of the composite function f(g(x^3)). \n\nFirst, maybe I should express f(g(x^3)) in terms of x and then evaluate it at -x to see how it behaves. Let me denote h(x) = f(g(x^3)), so h(-x) will be f(g((-x)^3)). Hmm, since (-x)^3 is equal to -x^3, this simplifies to h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)). \n\nBut wait, g is an odd function, so g(-y) = -g(y). Let me substitute y with x^3 in this equation, so g(-x^3) = -g(x^3). Therefore, h(-x) becomes f(-g(x^3)). \n\nNow, f is an even function, so f(-z) = f(z) for any z. Let me let z = g(x^3), so f(-g(x^3)) becomes f(g(x^3)). Therefore, h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) which is exactly h(x). \n\nSo that means h(-x) = h(x), which is the definition of an even function. So, f(g(x^3)) is an even function. Let me just go through that step by step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n1. Start with h(x) = f(g(x^3)).\n2. Compute h(-x): f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(-x^3)).\n3. Since g is odd, g(-x^3) = -g(x^3).\n4. So, h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)).\n5. Since f is even, f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)).\n6. And that is h(x).\n7. Hence, h(-x) = h(x), so h(x) is even.\n\nYeah, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in that reasoning. So, f(g(x^3)) should be even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine whether the function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1. Start with the function \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n2. Evaluate \\( h(-x) \\): \n   \\[\n   h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3))\n   \\]\n3. Simplify the argument inside \\( g \\):\n   \\[\n   (-x)^3 = -x^3\n   \\]\n   Thus,\n   \\[\n   h(-x) = f(g(-x^3))\n   \\]\n4. Since \\( g(x) \\) is odd, we have \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore,\n   \\[\n   h(-x) = f(-g(x^3))\n   \\]\n5. Since \\( f(x) \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). Hence,\n   \\[\n   h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x)\n   \\]\n6. This shows that \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), which means \\( h(x) \\) is an even function.\n\nThus, the function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>",

They told me that f(x) is even and g(x) is odd. Hmm, okay, let me recall what even and odd functions are.\n\nAn even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain. So, if I plug in -x, I get the same result as when I plug in x. Classic examples are functions like x\u00b2 or cos(x).\n\nAn odd function, on the other hand, satisfies g(-x) = -g(x). So, flipping the sign of x flips the sign of the output. Examples are x\u00b3, sin(x), etc.\n\nAlright, so we have to figure out the nature of f(g(x\u00b3)). Let\u2019s break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe I should figure out what happens when I plug in -x into f(g(x\u00b3)). If f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, then f(g(-x\u00b3)) should equal f(g(x\u00b3)). If it's odd, then f(g(-x\u00b3)) should equal -f(g(x\u00b3)). Otherwise, it would be neither.\n\nSo, let's compute f(g(-x\u00b3)).\n\nSince g is an odd function, g(-x\u00b3) should be equal to -g(x\u00b3). Okay, so:\n\nf(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-g(x\u00b3))\n\nNow, f is an even function, so f(-y) = f(y) for any y. Therefore, replacing y with g(x\u00b3):\n\nf(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3))\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nf(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3))\n\nWhich means f(g(x\u00b3)) satisfies f(-x) = f(x), right? Because replacing x with -x gives the same value.\n\nWait a second, does that make f(g(x\u00b3)) an even function?\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn\u2019t skip a step.\n\nWe had f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-g(x\u00b3)). Since f is even, -g(x\u00b3) inside f is the same as g(x\u00b3), so f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nTherefore, f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)), meaning f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nWait, is there another perspective? Maybe thinking about the composition of functions and their symmetries.\n\nLet me consider the composition f(g(x\u00b3)). The inside function is x\u00b3, which is odd because (-x)\u00b3 = -x\u00b3. So, the inside function is odd.\n\nThen, the outside function is f, which is even. So, f of an odd function? But how does that affect the composition?\n\nIf I recall, composing an even function around an odd function, what does that do? Hmm. Let me think about transformations.\n\nIf you have an even function, say f, and you plug another function h(x) into it. Then, f(h(-x)) = f(-h(x)) because h is odd. But since f is even, f(-h(x)) = f(h(x)). So, f(h(-x)) = f(h(x)).\n\nWhich means f(h(x)) is even.\n\nIn our problem, h(x) is x\u00b3, which is odd. Therefore, f(g(x\u00b3)) as a composition of an even function f around an odd function g(x\u00b3) is even.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, is x\u00b3 an odd function? Yes, because (-x)^3 = -x\u00b3.\n\nThen, g being odd, so plugging that in, I have g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). Then, plugging that into f, which is even, so f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nThat gives us f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)), so f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nLet me try testing it with specific functions to see if this makes sense.\n\nSuppose g(x) = x, which is definitely odd, and f(x) = x\u00b2, which is even. So, f(g(x\u00b3)) = (x\u00b3)\u00b2 = x^6. Is x^6 even? Yes, because (-x)^6 = x^6.\n\nAnother example: Let g(x) = x\u00b3 (which is odd), and f(x) = x^4 (even). Then, f(g(x)) = (x\u00b3)^4 = x^{12}, which is even.\n\nWait, maybe an example where g(x) is some other odd function, like g(x) = sin(x). Let f(x) = x\u00b2 (even). Then, f(g(x^3)) = (sin(x\u00b3))^2. Is that even?\n\nYes, because (sin((-x)^3))^2 = (sin(-x\u00b3))^2 = (-sin(x\u00b3))^2 = (sin(x\u00b3))^2. So, it's even.\n\nAnother test case: let g(x) = -x, which is odd, because g(-x) = -(-x) = x = -g(x). Wait, really? No, actually, g(-x) = -(-x) = x = -g(x) if g(x) = -x. Wait, plugging in x, g(x) = -x, so g(-x) = -(-x) = x, which is -g(x). So, it is odd. So, putting into f(x) = x^3, which is odd, but f needs to be even. So, f(g(x^3)) = (g(x^3))^3 = ( -x^9 )^3 = -x^{27}, which is odd. Wait, hold on, but f is supposed to be even. Wait, let me redo that.\n\nHold on, if f is even, so f(x) = |x| for example. Then, f(g(x\u00b3)) = |g(x\u00b3)|. Since g is odd, g(x\u00b3) is odd, so |g(x\u00b3)| is even, right? Because absolute value makes all negatives positive.\n\nWait, actually, if g(x) is odd, then g(x^3) is odd because x\u00b3 is odd so composing it with g (odd) gives odd, as substitution. So |g(x\u00b3)| is even because the absolute value wraps it, so flipping the sign doesn't matter. Therefore, even.\n\nBut maybe if f is x^2, which is even, f(g(x\u00b3)) = [g(x\u00b3)]\u00b2, which is [(-x\u00b3)]\u00b2 = x^6, which is even.\n\nWait, but if f is an even function and g is odd, f(g(x\u00b3)) is going to be f of something that is odd, but f is even, so f(-y) = f(y). Therefore, f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nWait, yeah, as in the first step. So, f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nThese test cases are showing it's even, so my conclusion seems right.\n\nWait, let me see one more test case where f and g might be more complicated. Suppose f(x) = |x| + x\u00b2, which is even, and g(x) = x, which is odd. Then, f(g(x\u00b3)) = |x\u00b3| + (x\u00b3)\u00b2 = |x\u00b3| + x^6, which is even because absolute value is even and x^6 is even. So, sum is even.\n\nAnother example: f(x) = e^{x} + e^{-x}, which is even, since substituting -x gives e^{-x} + e^{x} which is the same. If g(x) is any odd function, say, g(x) = x. Then, f(g(x\u00b3)) = e^{x\u00b3} + e^{-x\u00b3}, which is even.\n\nWait, is that even? Because if I put -x, I get e^{-x\u00b3} + e^{x\u00b3}, which is the same as before. So yes, even yes.\n\nWait, another odd function for g: g(x) = x^3, so that's an odd function, plug into an even f(x). If f(x) = x^4, then f(g(x\u00b3)) is (x^3)^4 = x^{12}, which is even. If f(x) is |x|, then f(g(x\u00b3)) = |x^3| = |x| x^2, which is even.\n\nSo, all my test cases are giving me that f(g(x\u00b3)) is even. Therefore, I think it's safe to conclude it's even.\n\nWait, what would happen if g were even? Then, g(-x) = g(x), so f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)), and if f is even as well, then f(g(x\u00b3)) would still be even. But in this case, g is odd, so that composition flips to f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)), so the same function.\n\nSo, yeah, seems that as long as f is even and g is odd, then f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to think in terms of composition properties. So, f(g(x\u00b3)) is a composition where the innermost function is x\u00b3 which is odd, composing with g, which is odd, so the result is still odd if you consider g(x\u00b3). Then, f is even, so function f applied to an odd function.\n\nBut when you apply an even function on an odd function, do you get even or odd? So, if h(x) is odd, then f(h(x)) where f is even. Then, f(h(-x)) = f(-h(x)) = f(h(x)). So, f(h(-x)) = f(h(x)), which means f(h(x)) is even.\n\nHence f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nSo, that seems to fit.\n\nAlternatively, because x\u00b3 is odd, the composition inside is g(x\u00b3), which is odd, then f is even, so the outer function is even, so when you apply it to an odd function, you get an even function.\n\nHence, all of these lines of thought lead me to the conclusion that it's even. Therefore, the answer should be even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nTo determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither, we start by recalling the properties of even and odd functions.

I need to determine whether the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\nFirst, let me recall some definitions. An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in its domain. On the other hand, an odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). Now, I need to analyze the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nLet me break it down step by step. The composition involves three functions: first, \\( x^3 \\), then \\( g \\), and finally \\( f \\). So, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is a composition of these three functions.\n\nSince \\( x^3 \\) is a function, let's think about whether it's even or odd. Remember, \\( (x)^3 \\) is an odd function because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\). So, the innermost function \\( x^3 \\) is odd.\n\nNext, \\( g(x) \\) is given as an odd function, so if I apply \\( g \\) to \\( x^3 \\), which is odd, how does that affect the result? Let me compute \\( g(x^3) \\). If \\( g \\) is odd, then \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). But since we're dealing with \\( g \\) applied to \\( x^3 \\), maybe it's helpful to consider substituting \\( -x \\) into \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) and see what happens.\n\nSo, let's define \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\). To check if \\( h(x) \\) is even or odd, I'll compute \\( h(-x) \\) and compare it to \\( h(x) \\) and \\( -h(x) \\).\n\nComputing \\( h(-x) \\):\n\n\\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\)  \nSimplify \\( (-x)^3 \\).  \n\\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\), so  \n\\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n\nNow, since \\( g \\) is an odd function, \\( g(-y) = -g(y) \\) for any y. Let me set \\( y = x^3 \\), so:\n\n\\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).  \nTherefore,  \n\\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).  \nBut \\( f \\) is an even function. Applying an even function to \\( -g(x^3) \\) gives:  \n\\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), because \\( f(-a) = f(a) \\) when \\( f \\) is even.\n\nSo, \\( h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( h(x) \\) satisfies the condition for being an even function: \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\). Hence, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\nWait, let me go through that again to make sure I haven't missed anything. Starting with \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\). \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\) because \\( g \\) is odd. Then, passing this through \\( f \\), which is even, so \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). That brings us back to \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so yes, it's definitely even.\n\nIs there a possibility that this could be neither? Hmm, not unless maybe the composition somehow disrupts the evenness or oddness in a non-uniform way, but in this case, each step follows from the properties of even and odd functions.\n\nWait, let me think about function composition in general. So, if I have f(g(x)), where f is even and g is odd, does it always result in an even function?\n\nLet me test with concrete functions. Let me choose f(x) = x\u00b2 (which is even) and g(x) = x\u00b3 (which is odd). Then, f(g(x)) = (x\u00b3)\u00b2 = x\u2076, which is even, because substituting -x gives (-x)^6 = x^6, same as f(g(x)). So that's consistent.\n\nAnother example: Let f(x) = cos(x) which is even, and g(x) = sin(x) which is odd. Then f(g(x)) = cos(sin(x)). Now, is this even? Let's test for x:\n\nf(g(-x)) = cos(sin(-x)) = cos(-sin(x)) = cos(sin(x)) because cosine is even. Therefore, f(g(-x)) = f(g(x)), so it is even. Therefore, this composition is also even.\n\nConversely, if I have f(x) even and g(x) odd, another thought: What if f is a reflection or something else? Wait, f and g are arbitrary functions with those parity properties. So as long as f is even, applying f to an odd function in this way gives an even result.\n\nWait a sec, but in the composition, do we ensure anything about the function's expression? For instance, is it always that way regardless of what f and g are, as long as f is even and g is odd?\n\nLet me see. Suppose f is another even function, say f(x) = x^4, and g(x) = x^3. Then, f(g(x)) = (x^3)^4 = x^{12}, which is even. So it still holds. What if I choose f(x) = |x|, which is even, and g(x) = x^3, which is odd? Then f(g(x)) is |x^3|, which is even as | -x^3 | = |x^3|. So yes.\n\nWhat if g(x) is a more complicated odd function? For example, \\( g(x) = x - x^3 \\). Wait, is that odd? Let's check: g(-x) = (-x) - (-x)^3 = -x - (-x^3) = -x + x^3. Which is not equal to -g(x), because -g(x) = -x + x^3. So in that case, g(x) would satisfy g(-x) = -g(x), meaning it is still odd.\n\nThen, \\( f(g(x)) = (x - x^3)^2 \\), which is even, because squared removes any negative signs.\n\nAlternatively, let me try another approach without plugging in specific functions. Let's compose f and g symbolically.\n\nSince \\( f(x) \\) is even, we know \\( f(-a) = f(a) \\) for any \\( a \\). Let \\( a = g(x^3) \\), then \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). Now, \\( g \\) is odd, so \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). So if I consider \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\), but as \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\). So \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so \\( h(x) \\) is even.\n\nThus, in every case, regardless of what f and g are (as long as f is even and g is odd), the composition \\( f \\circ g \\circ (-x^3) \\) will result in an even function.\n\nWait a moment, what if I made a mistake in how the functions compose? Hmm, the composition is \\( f(g(x^3)) \\), so x is cubed first, then g is applied, then f is applied. So \\( x^3 \\) is in the inner argument of g, which is odd, and then f is an even function on that result.\n\nHmm, another thing, let's suppose \\( f \\) is a non-trivial even function and \\( g \\) is a non-trivial odd function. Is their composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) necessarily even? Since the composition only involves substituting \\( -x \\) into \\( g(x^3) \\), which, since \\( g \\) is odd, negates the whole expression, but then \\( f \\) is even, so it doesn't negate anything.\n\nSo seems like no matter what, substituting \\( -x \\) in the outermost function doesn't change the result because \\( f \\) is even, negating the entire inner function, but after \\( g \\) is already odd.\n\nTherefore, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\nBut wait, just to test an example where perhaps the composition would not be even? Is that possible?\n\nWait, if we mess with the order, for example, suppose \\( f(g x) \\) then cube it, but in our case, it's \\( f(g(x^3)) \\), so the structure is fixed. Maybe if the functions were inside differently, but here it's as above.\n\nAlternatively, taking \\( x \\rightarrow -x \\):\n\nf(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(-x^3)) because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\).  \nThen, since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).  \nThus, \\( f(-g(x^3)) \\).  \nBut \\( f \\) is even, so \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nSo again, we get \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so h is even.\n\nTherefore, in the given composition order, f(g(x^3)), where f is even, g is odd, \\( x^3 \\) is odd.\n\nTherefore, it's even.\n\nWait, so it can't be neither because it is equal to h(-x) = h(x). So that suggests it is even.\n\nBut maybe we can think if there is a case when it could be neither.\n\nIs there an instance where substituting the negative variable leads to something different that's not h(x) but not equal to h(-x)?\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nDefine a specific even f and odd g and see.\n\nLet f(x) = x^4 (even), g(x) = x^5 (odd), so f(g(x^3)) = (x^3)^5)^4? Wait, hold on. Wait, f(g(x)) is f(x^5) when given x^3.\n\nWait, wait, doh, let's fix that.\n\nWait, \\( f(g(x^3)) = (g(x^3))^4 \\) because f(x) is x^4.

I need to figure out whether f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, odd, or neither. Hmm, let's start by recalling what it means for a function to be even or odd.\n\nAn even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain. On the other hand, an odd function satisfies g(-x) = -g(x) for all x in its domain. So, f(x) is even, meaning if I plug in -x, it's the same as plugging in x. And g(x) is odd, meaning plugging in -x flips the sign of the function.\n\nI need to analyze the function h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)). Let's see, I should check if h(-x) equals h(x) or -h(x) or neither. That will tell me if h(x) is even, odd, or neither.\n\nStarting with h(-x), which is f(g((-x)\u00b3)). Let me compute the inside first: (-x)\u00b3. Since any odd power preserves the sign, (-x)\u00b3 = -x\u00b3. So, h(-x) becomes f(g(-x\u00b3)).\n\nNow, since g is an odd function, g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). So, substituting that back, h(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)). \n\nNow, looking at f(-g(x\u00b3)). Since f is even, f(-t) = f(t) for any t. Let's set t = g(x\u00b3). So, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)). Therefore, h(-x) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nBut wait, f(g(x\u00b3)) is exactly h(x). So, h(-x) = h(x). That means h(x) is even. \n\nLet me recap to make sure. Starting with h(-x), substitute in, use the properties of f and g. Since g is odd, (-x)^3 is -x\u00b3, and then since f is even, f of negative something is just f of that something. So, h(-x) equals h(x), hence h is even. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in that reasoning. The key steps were recognizing that x\u00b3 is odd, so (-x)\u00b3 is -x\u00b3, then using the oddness of g to bring out the negative, and then the evenness of f to remove the negative. It all works out that h(-x) equals h(x).\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider specific examples to see if it makes sense. Suppose g(x) is something simple, like g(x) = x, which is odd. Then g(x\u00b3) = x\u00b3. So then f(g(x\u00b3)) = f(x\u00b3). Now, f is even, so f(-x\u00b3) = f(x\u00b3). Therefore, f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-x\u00b3) = f(x\u00b3) = f(g(x\u00b3)), which shows that h(-x) = h(x), confirming that h is even.\n\nAlternatively, take g(x) = x\u00b3, which is also odd. Then, g(x\u00b3) = x\u2079, which is also odd. Then, h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = f(x\u2079). Since f is even, plugging in x\u2079 or -x\u2079 doesn't change the value; f(x\u2079) = f(-x\u2079). Therefore, h(-x\u00b3) = f(-x\u2079) = f(x\u2079) = h(x\u00b3), so again h is even. \n\nWait, actually, no\u2014hold on, in this case, since h(-x) is f(g((-x)^3)) = f((-x)^3 * something). Wait, maybe examples can be tricky because the function might behave differently. Let me think of another example.\n\nSay f(x) is x\u00b2, which is even. Let g(x) be x\u00b3, which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) would be (x\u00b3)\u00b2 = x\u2076, which is even. Because f(g(-x\u00b3)) = (-x\u00b3)\u00b2 = x\u2076, which is same as f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nAnother example, f(x) = |x|, which is even. Take g(x) = x - x\u00b3, which is odd since -g(x) = -(x - x\u00b3) = -x + x\u00b3 = - (x - x\u00b3) = g(-x). So f(g(x\u00b3)) = |x\u00b3 - (x\u00b3)\u00b3| = |x\u00b3 - x\u2079|. Now, f(g(-x\u00b3)) = |(-x\u00b3) - (-x\u00b3)^3| = | -x\u00b3 - (-x\u2079)| = | -x\u00b3 + x\u2079 | = |x\u2079 -x\u00b3|. Since absolute value doesn't care about the sign, this is the same as |x\u00b3 - x\u2079| which is equal to f(g(x\u00b3)). So, h(-x\u00b3) = h(x\u00b3), meaning h is even.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So the conclusion is that in these cases, it seems to hold. So, probably the answer is even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\nAn even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) and an odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\nLet \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nTo determine if \\( h(x) \\) is even or odd, we evaluate \\( h(-x) \\):\n- \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\)\n- Since \\((-x)^3 = -x^3\\), we have \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\)\n- Because \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\), so \\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\)\n- Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\)\n\nThus, \\( h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\), which means \\( h(x) \\) is even.\n\nTherefore, the function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\(\\boxed{even}\\).<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>"

Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you multiply two polynomials, the degree of the resulting polynomial is the sum of the degrees of the two polynomials being multiplied. Here, the left side is (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) multiplied by p(x), and the right side is a fourth-degree polynomial, which is x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25. So, if I let the degree of p(x) be n, then 2 + n = 4 because the left side will have degree 2 + n. Therefore, n must be 2, which means p(x) is a quadratic polynomial. So, p(x) must be of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are constants that I need to find.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation: (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5)(ax\u00b2 + bx + c) = x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25. My job is to expand the left side and then compare the coefficients with the right side to find a, b, and c.\n\nLet me expand the left side step by step. I'll distribute each term in (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) across each term in (ax\u00b2 + bx + c):\n\nFirst, multiply x\u00b2 by each term in (ax\u00b2 + bx + c):\n- x\u00b2 * ax\u00b2 = a x\u2074\n- x\u00b2 * bx = b x\u00b3\n- x\u00b2 * c = c x\u00b2\n\nNext, multiply -3x by each term in (ax\u00b2 + bx + c):\n- -3x * ax\u00b2 = -3a x\u00b3\n- -3x * bx = -3b x\u00b2\n- -3x * c = -3c x\n\nThen, multiply 5 by each term in (ax\u00b2 + bx + c):\n- 5 * ax\u00b2 = 5a x\u00b2\n- 5 * bx = 5b x\n- 5 * c = 5c\n\nSo, combining all these terms, the left side becomes:\na x\u2074 + b x\u00b3 + c x\u00b2 - 3a x\u00b3 - 3b x\u00b2 - 3c x + 5a x\u00b2 + 5b x + 5c\n\nNow, I need to combine the like terms:\n\nFor x\u2074: a x\u2074\n\nFor x\u00b3: b x\u00b3 - 3a x\u00b3 = (b - 3a) x\u00b3\n\nFor x\u00b2: c x\u00b2 - 3b x\u00b2 + 5a x\u00b2 = (c - 3b + 5a) x\u00b2\n\nFor x: -3c x + 5b x = ( -3c + 5b ) x\n\nConstant term: 5c\n\nSo, putting it all together, the expanded form is:\na x\u2074 + (b - 3a) x\u00b3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x\u00b2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c\n\nNow, this should be equal to the right side, x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25.\n\nTherefore, we can set up equations by comparing coefficients for each power of x.\n\nLet me write down these equations:\n\n1. Coefficient of x\u2074: a = 1\n2. Coefficient of x\u00b3: b - 3a = -3\n3. Coefficient of x\u00b2: c - 3b + 5a = 0 (since there's no x\u00b2 term on the right side)\n4. Coefficient of x: (-3c + 5b) = 15\n5. Constant term: 5c = -25\n\nOkay, now I can solve these equations step by step.\n\nStarting with equation 1: a = 1. That gives me a = 1.\n\nPlug a = 1 into equation 2: b - 3(1) = -3 => b - 3 = -3. Adding 3 to both sides gives b = 0.\n\nNow, with a = 1 and b = 0, let's move to equation 3: c - 3(0) + 5(1) = 0 => c + 5 = 0 => c = -5.\n\nNow, check equation 4 with b = 0 and c = -5: (-3*(-5) + 5*0) = 15 + 0 = 15, which matches the right side (15). So, equation 4 is satisfied.\n\nFinally, equation 5: 5c = -25. With c = -5, let's check this: 5*(-5) = -25, which is correct.\n\nSo, all equations have been satisfied with a = 1, b = 0, c = -5. Therefore, the polynomial p(x) is ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 1x\u00b2 + 0x - 5, which simplifies to x\u00b2 - 5.\n\nLet me quickly double-check my solution by multiplying (x\u00b2 - 3x +5) by (x\u00b2 -5) to make sure I get x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25.\n\nMultiplying:\n\nFirst, x\u00b2 times x\u00b2 = x\u2074\n\nx\u00b2 times (-5) = -5x\u00b2\n\n-3x times x\u00b2 = -3x\u00b3\n\n-3x times (-5) = 15x\n\n5 times x\u00b2 = 5x\u00b2\n\n5 times (-5) = -25\n\nSo, combining:\n\nx\u2074\n\n-3x\u00b3\n\n-5x\u00b2 + 5x\u00b2 = 0x\u00b2\n\n15x\n\n-25\n\nSo, putting altogether: x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25, which is x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Perfect, that's exactly the right side. So, p(x) = x\u00b2 -5.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. Let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Also, just to be sure, is there any other way this could be approached?\n\nAnother possible method is polynomial division: divide x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x -25 by x\u00b2 -3x +5 and see if I get p(x).\n\nLet me try that.\n\nDivide x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25 by x\u00b2 -3x +5.\n\nSetting it up:\n\nDividend: x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +0x\u00b2 +15x -25\n\nDivisor: x\u00b2 -3x +5\n\nWe divide term by term.\n\nFirst term: x\u2074 divided by x\u00b2 is x\u00b2.\n\nMultiply divisor by x\u00b2: x\u00b2*(x\u00b2 -3x +5)=x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2\n\nSubtract this from the dividend:\n\n(x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +0x\u00b2 +15x -25) - (x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2) = 0x\u2074 +0x\u00b3 -5x\u00b2 +15x -25\n\nSo, now we have: -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nNext, divide this by the divisor x\u00b2 -3x +5. The leading term is -5x\u00b2 divided by x\u00b2 is -5.\n\nMultiply divisor by -5: -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nSubtract this from the current dividend:\n\n(-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) - (-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) = 0\n\nSo, no remainder. Thus, the quotient is x\u00b2 -5, which is exactly what I found earlier.\n\nOkay, that's another way to verify it, and the result is the same. So, p(x) is definitely x\u00b2 -5.\n\nWait, just one more check. Let me try synthetic division or another method.\n\nBut dividing a quartic by a quadratic, long division is probably straightforward, which I just did, and it worked.\n\nAlternatively, I can also try plugging in some values.\n\nLet me suppose p(x) = x\u00b2 -5, then when x=1, (1 -3 +5)p(1) = (3)(1 -5)=3*(-4)=-12; On the right side, x=1: 1 -3 +15 -25= (1-3)=-2, (15-25)=-10, so total is (-12). So, yes, it matches.\n\nAnother test, x=0: Left side: p(0)*(0 - 0 +5)=?\n\nWait, No, for x=0, plugging in, left side is (0 -0 +5)*p(0)=5*p(0). Right side is 0 -0 +0 -25 = -25. So, 5*p(0) = -25, which implies p(0)= -5. Looking at p(x)=x\u00b2 -5, p(0)=0 -5= -5, which is correct. That's consistent.\n\nTest another value: x=2. Left side: (4 -6 +5)*p(2)= (3)* (4 -5)=3*(-1)=-3.\n\nRight side: 16 -24 +30 -25= (16-24)= -8, (30-25)=5. So, (-8+5)= -3. Which matches. So, yeah, p(2) is 4-5=-1, and 3*(-1)= -3. That's good.\n\nHmm. Alright, I think I've verified it enough.\n\nThe polynomial p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\(\\boxed{x^2 - 5}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25\\), we start by noting that the degree of \\( p(x) \\) must be 2 since the product on the left side is a fourth-degree polynomial.

Let's expand term by term.\n\nMultiply \\( x^2 \\) by each term in \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\):\n- \\( x^2 * ax^2 = a x^4 \\)\n- \\( x^2 * bx = b x^3 \\)\n- \\( x^2 * c = c x^2 \\)\n\nNext, multiply \\( -3x \\) by each term in \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\):\n- \\( -3x * ax^2 = -3a x^3 \\)\n- \\( -3x * bx = -3b x^2 \\)\n- \\( -3x * c = -3c x \\)\n\nThen, multiply \\( 5 \\) by each term in \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\):\n- \\( 5 * ax^2 = 5a x^2 \\)\n- \\( 5 * bx = 5b x \\)\n- \\( 5 * c = 5c \\)\n\nNow, let's write down all these terms together:\n\n1. \\( a x^4 \\)\n2. \\( b x^3 \\)\n3. \\( c x^2 \\)\n4. \\( -3a x^3 \\)\n5. \\( -3b x^2 \\)\n6. \\( -3c x \\)\n7. \\( 5a x^2 \\)\n8. \\( 5b x \\)\n9. \\( 5c \\)\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\nFirst, for \\( x^4 \\):\n- Only term 1: \\( a x^4 \\)\n\nNext, \\( x^3 \\):\n- Term 2: \\( b x^3 \\)\n- Term 4: \\( -3a x^3 \\)\nSo, combined: \\( (b - 3a) x^3 \\)\n\nNext, \\( x^2 \\):\n- Term 3: \\( c x^2 \\)\n- Term 5: \\( -3b x^2 \\)\n- Term 7: \\( 5a x^2 \\)\nCombined: \\( (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 \\)\n\nNext, \\( x \\):\n- Term 6: \\( -3c x \\)\n- Term 8: \\( 5b x \\)\nCombined: \\( (-3c + 5b) x \\)\n\nFinally, constant term:\n- Term 9: \\( 5c \\)\n\nSo putting it all together, the product is:\n\n\\( a x^4 + (b - 3a) x^3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c \\)\n\nAnd this product equals the given quartic: \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nNow, let's set the coefficients equal for each power of \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, since the product must equal the given polynomial, their corresponding coefficients must match.\n\nStarting with the highest degree, which is \\( x^4 \\):\n\n1. Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\) in the product: \\( a \\)\n   - Coefficient in the given polynomial: 1\n   - So, equation: \\( a = 1 \\)\n\nNext, \\( x^3 \\):\n2. Coefficient in product: \\( b - 3a \\)\n   - Coefficient in given poly.: -3\n   - Equation: \\( b - 3a = -3 \\)\n   Since \\( a = 1 \\), substitute:\n   \\( b - 3(1) = -3 \\)\n   \\( b - 3 = -3 \\)\n   Add 3 to both sides: \\( b = 0 \\)\n\nHmm, so \\( b = 0 \\). Interesting, so the linear term in \\( p(x) \\) is zero. That might have been expected or not; let me keep going.\n\nNext, coefficient of \\( x^2 \\):\n3. Coefficient in product: \\( c - 3b + 5a \\)\n   - Coefficient in given poly.: 0 (since there is no \\( x^2 \\) term, it's implicitly 0)\n   So, equation: \\( c - 3b + 5a = 0 \\)\n   Substitute \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\):\n   \\( c - 0 + 5(1) = 0 \\)\n   \\( c + 5 = 0 \\)\n   Therefore, \\( c = -5 \\)\n\nOkay, moving on to the coefficient of \\( x \\):\n\n4. Coefficient in product: \\( -3c + 5b \\)\n   - Coefficient in given poly.: 15\n   So, equation: \\( -3c + 5b = 15 \\)\n   Substitute \\( b = 0 \\) and \\( c = -5 \\):\n   \\( -3*(-5) + 5*0 = 15 \\)\n   \\( 15 + 0 = 15 \\)\n   That's good, 15=15, which is consistent.\n\nLastly, the constant term:\n\n5. Coefficient in product: \\( 5c \\)\n   - Coefficient in given poly.: -25\n   So, equation: \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n   Substitute \\( c = -5 \\):\n   \\( 5*(-5) = -25 \\)\n   \\( -25 = -25 \\)\n   Perfect, that works out.\n\nSo, in summary, we found:\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = 0 \\)\n- \\( c = -5 \\)\n\nTherefore, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is:\n\n\\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = 1x^2 + 0x + (-5) = x^2 - 5 \\)\n\nLet me just verify this to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's multiply \\( x^2 - 3x +5 \\) by \\( x^2 - 5 \\) and check if we get the given quartic.\n\nMultiplying them together:\n\nFirst, \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)(x^2 - 5) \\)\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\n1. \\( x^2 * x^2 = x^4 \\)\n2. \\( x^2 * (-5) = -5x^2 \\)\n3. \\( -3x * x^2 = -3x^3 \\)\n4. \\( -3x * (-5) = 15x \\)\n5. \\( 5 * x^2 = 5x^2 \\)\n6. \\( 5 * (-5) = -25 \\)\n\nCombine these terms:\n\n\\( x^4 - 5x^2 - 3x^3 + 15x + 5x^2 -25 \\)\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n- \\( x^4 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 \\)\n- \\( (-5x^2 + 5x^2) = 0x^2 \\)\n- \\( 15x \\)\n- \\( -25 \\)\n\nSo the result is:\n\n\\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x -25 \\)\n\nWhich is exactly the given polynomial. So yes, that checks out. Therefore, my solution is correct.\n\nSo, to recap, by representing \\( p(x) \\) as a quadratic and matching coefficients, I found that \\( p(x) \\) is \\( x^2 - 5 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that\n\\[ (x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25, \\]\nwe start by noting that \\( p(x) \\) must be a quadratic polynomial, as the given polynomial is of degree 4 and we are multiplying by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).

Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\): \\( a = 1 \\)\n2. Coefficient of \\( x^3 \\): \\( b - 3a = -3 \\)\n3. Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\): \\( c - 3b + 5a = 0 \\)\n4. Coefficient of \\( x \\): \\( -3c + 5b = 15 \\)\n5. Constant term: \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\nSolving these equations step-by-step:\n1. From \\( a = 1 \\), we get \\( a = 1 \\).\n2.

Hmm, okay. So, essentially, I have the equation:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25\n\\]\n\nMy goal is to solve for \\( p(x) \\). I think a good way to approach this is by performing polynomial division, right? Because if I divide the right-hand side polynomial by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\), the result should be \\( p(x) \\). \n\nLet me recall how polynomial division works. It's kind of like long division with numbers, but involving polynomials. The steps are to divide the leading term of the dividend by the leading term of the divisor, multiply the entire divisor by that result, subtract from the dividend, and repeat the process with the new polynomial. \n\nSo first, let me write down the dividend and the divisor more clearly. The dividend is \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25 \\) because I notice that the original right-hand side didn't have an \\( x^2 \\) term, so I'll include a zero coefficient for that to make it easier. The divisor is \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\nLet me set up the long division:\n\nDividing \\( x^4 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) gives me \\( x^2 \\). So, I write \\( x^2 \\) above the division line. Then, I multiply \\( x^2 \\) by the divisor \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\), which gives me:\n\n\\( x^2 \\times x^2 = x^4 \\),\n\\( x^2 \\times (-3x) = -3x^3 \\),\n\\( x^2 \\times 5 = 5x^2 \\).\n\nSo, that gives \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).\n\nNext, I subtract this result from the original dividend:\n\n\\( (x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x -25) - (x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2) \\).\n\nLet me subtract term by term:\n\n- \\( x^4 - x^4 = 0 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 - (-3x^3) = 0 \\)\n- \\( 0x^2 - 5x^2 = -5x^2 \\)\n- \\( 15x - 0x = 15x \\)\n- \\( -25 - 0 = -25 \\)\n\nSo, the subtraction results in \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nNow, I bring down the remaining terms, but in this case, all terms have been accounted for, so the next dividend is \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nNow, I divide the leading term \\( -5x^2 \\) by the leading term of the divisor \\( x^2 \\), which is \\( -5 \\). So, I write \\( -5 \\) as the next term in the quotient.\n\nThen, I multiply \\( -5 \\) by the divisor \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\):\n\n\\( -5 \\times x^2 = -5x^2 \\),\n\\( -5 \\times (-3x) = 15x \\),\n\\( -5 \\times 5 = -25 \\).\n\nSo, that gives \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nAgain, I subtract this from the current polynomial:\n\n\\( (-5x^2 + 15x -25) - (-5x^2 + 15x -25) = 0 \\).\n\nSo, there's no remainder left, which is great. That means the division comes out perfectly, and the quotient is what I've found so far: \\( x^2 - 5 \\).\n\nWait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the beginning: I divided \\( x^4 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( x^2 \\), then multiplied \\( x^2 \\) by the divisor, got \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\), subtract that from \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25 \\), which gave me \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\). Then, I divided \\( -5x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( -5 \\), multiplied it by the divisor: \\( -5x^2 +15x -25 \\), and subtracted to get a remainder of 0. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the polynomial \\( p(x) = x^2 - 5 \\). Let me just verify by multiplying \\( x^2 - 3x +5 \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\) to see if I get the original polynomial.\n\nLet me perform this multiplication:\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( x^4 \\).\n\nThen \\( x^2 \\times -5 \\) gives \\( -5x^2 \\).\n\nNow, multiply \\( -3x \\) by \\( x^2 \\): \\( -3x^3 \\).\n\nThen, \\( -3x \\times -5 \\): \\( +15x \\).\n\nNext, \\( 5 \\times x^2 \\): \\( 5x^2 \\).\n\n\\( 5 \\times -5 \\): \\( -25 \\).\n\nSo now, writing all these terms together:\n\n\\( x^4 -5x^2 -3x^3 +15x +5x^2 -25 \\).\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\n\\( x^4 -3x^3 + (-5x^2 +5x^2) +15x -25 \\).\n\nSimplifies to:\n\n\\( x^4 -3x^3 + 0x^2 +15x -25 \\).\n\nWhich is exactly \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\), which is the given polynomial. \n\nSo, that confirms that when I multiply \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\), I indeed get the desired result.\n\nTherefore, I think my solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25,\n\\]\n\nwe perform polynomial long division of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n1. Divide the leading term \\( x^4 \\) by the leading term \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( x^2 \\).\n2. Multiply \\( x^2 \\) by the divisor \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) to get \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).\n3. Subtract this result from the original polynomial:\n   \\[\n   (x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25) - (x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2) = -5x^2 + 15x - 25.\n   \\]\n4. Divide the leading term \\( -5x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( -5 \\).\n5. Multiply \\( -5 \\) by the divisor \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) to get \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\).\n6. Subtract this result from the previous remainder:\n   \\[\n   (-5x^2 + 15x - 25) - (-5x^2 + 15x - 25) = 0.\n   \\]\n\nThe quotient from the division is \\( x^2 - 5 \\), and there is no remainder.

Let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that if I have two polynomials multiplied together and the result is another polynomial, the degrees of the polynomials should add up. Let me check, the degree of \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) is 2, and we're looking for \\( p(x) \\). The product is \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\), which is a degree 4 polynomial. So, since \\( 2 + \\text{degree of } p = 4 \\), the degree of \\( p(x) \\) must be \\( 2 \\). That makes sense. So \\( p(x) \\) is a quadratic polynomial.\n\nLet me denote \\( p(x) \\) as \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants that I need to find. \n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x -25 \\)\n\nAlright, now I need to multiply out the left-hand side and then equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \\( x \\) to the right-hand side. That way, I can set up equations for each coefficient and solve for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nLet me multiply \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) by \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\):\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 \\) by each term in \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\):\n- \\( x^2 \\times ax^2 = a x^4 \\)\n- \\( x^2 \\times bx = b x^3 \\)\n- \\( x^2 \\times c = c x^2 \\)\n\nNext, multiply \\( -3x \\) by each term:\n- \\( -3x \\times ax^2 = -3a x^3 \\)\n- \\( -3x \\times bx = -3b x^2 \\)\n- \\( -3x \\times c = -3c x \\)\n\nThen, multiply \\( 5 \\) by each term:\n- \\( 5 \\times ax^2 = 5a x^2 \\)\n- \\( 5 \\times bx = 5b x \\)\n- \\( 5 \\times c = 5c \\)\n\nNow let's write all these terms out:\n\n1. \\( a x^4 \\)\n2. \\( b x^3 + (-3a) x^3 \\) [since \\( b x^3 - 3a x^3 \\)]\n3. \\( c x^2 + (-3b) x^2 + 5a x^2 \\) [since \\( c x^2 - 3b x^2 + 5a x^2 \\)]\n4. \\( (-3c x) + (5b x) = (5b - 3c) x \\)\n5.

Let \\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\).\n\nWe multiply \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) by \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) and equate the coefficients of the resulting polynomial to those of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nExpanding the product:\n\n1. \\( x^2 \\times ax^2 = a x^4 \\)\n2. \\( x^2 \\times bx = b x^3 \\)\n3. \\( x^2 \\times c = c x^2 \\)\n4. \\( -3x \\times ax^2 = -3a x^3 \\)\n5. \\( -3x \\times bx = -3b x^2 \\)\n6. \\( -3x \\times c = -3c x \\)\n7. \\( 5 \\times ax^2 = 5a x^2 \\)\n8. \\( 5 \\times bx = 5b x \\)\n9. \\( 5 \\times c = 5c \\)\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n- The \\( x^4 \\) term: \\( a \\)\n- The \\( x^3 \\) terms: \\( b - 3a \\)\n- The \\( x^2 \\) terms: \\( c - 3b + 5a \\)\n- The \\( x \\) term: \\( 5b - 3c \\)\n- The constant term: \\( 5c \\)\n\nEquating these to the coefficients of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\):\n\n1. \\( a = 1 \\)\n2. \\( b - 3a = -3 \\)\n3. \\( c - 3b + 5a = 0 \\)\n4. \\( 5b - 3c = 15 \\)\n5. \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\nSolving these equations:\n\n1.

From \\( 5b - 3c = 15 \\), substituting \\( c = -5 \\), we get \\( 5b + 15 = 15 \\) leading to \\( b = 0 \\).\n4. Checking consistency, \\( b - 3a = -3 \\) gives \\( 0 - 3(1) = -3 \\), which is true.\n5. Checking consistency, \\( c - 3b + 5a = 0 \\) gives \\( -5 - 0 + 5(1) = 0 \\), which is true.\n\nThus, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\( x^2 - 5 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x^2 - 5}\n\\]<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>",
        "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c><\uff5cUser\uff5c>Please solve the following mathematical problem, placing your final answer within \\boxed{}:\nFind the polynomial $p(x)$ if\n$$(x^2-3x+5)p(x) = x^4-3x^3+15x-25.$$<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where I need to find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that when I multiply it by \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) \\), I get \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). Hmm, okay. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if I have two polynomials multiplied together and I can express one as the product of the other and another polynomial, division is the key. Since \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) \\) is a quadratic polynomial, and we're multiplying it by another polynomial \\( p(x) \\) to get a quartic (degree 4) polynomial. That means \\( p(x) \\) must be a quadratic polynomial itself because when you multiply a quadratic by a quadratic, you get a quartic.\n\nLet me write that down. If \\( p(x) \\) is quadratic, then I can express it as \\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\). Then, multiplying \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) \\) by \\( (ax^2 + bx + c) \\) should equal the given quartic. So, my goal is to find the coefficients \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nLet me set that up. The multiplication would look like:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c)\n\\]\n\nI need to expand this product and then equate it to the given polynomial \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). After expanding, I can compare coefficients of corresponding powers of \\( x \\) to set up equations for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nAlright, let's carry out the multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll distribute \\( ax^2 \\) across each term in the first polynomial:\n\n- \\( x^2 \\cdot ax^2 = a x^{4} \\)\n- \\( (-3x) \\cdot ax^2 = -3a x^{3} \\)\n- \\( 5 \\cdot ax^2 = 5a x^{2} \\)\n\nNext, distribute \\( bx \\) across each term in the first polynomial:\n\n- \\( x^2 \\cdot bx = b x^{3} \\)\n- \\( (-3x) \\cdot bx = -3b x^{2} \\)\n- \\( 5 \\cdot bx = 5b x \\)\n\nThen, distribute \\( c \\) across each term in the first polynomial:\n\n- \\( x^2 \\cdot c = c x^{2} \\)\n- \\( (-3x) \\cdot c = -3c x \\)\n- \\( 5 \\cdot c = 5c \\)\n\nNow, let's write all these terms out:\n\n1. \\( a x^{4} \\)\n2. \\( -3a x^{3} \\)\n3. \\( 5a x^{2} \\)\n4. \\( b x^{3} \\)\n5. \\( -3b x^{2} \\)\n6. \\( 5b x \\)\n7. \\( c x^{2} \\)\n8. \\( -3c x \\)\n9. \\( 5c \\)\n\nNext, I need to combine like terms.\n\nLooking for \\( x^{4} \\) terms: only the first term, which is \\( a x^{4} \\). So that coefficient is \\( a \\).\n\nFor \\( x^{3} \\) terms: we have \\( -3a x^{3} \\) and \\( b x^{3} \\), so when combined, it's \\( (-3a + b) x^{3} \\).\n\nFor \\( x^{2} \\) terms: \\( 5a x^{2} \\), \\( -3b x^{2} \\), and \\( c x^{2} \\), so combined, that's \\( (5a - 3b + c) x^{2} \\).\n\nFor \\( x \\) terms: \\( 5b x \\) and \\( -3c x \\), so combined, that's \\( (5b - 3c) x \\).\n\nAnd the constant term is just \\( 5c \\).\n\nSo summarizing, the entire expansion is:\n\n\\[\na x^{4} + (-3a + b) x^{3} + (5a - 3b + c)x^{2} + (5b - 3c) x + 5c\n\\]\n\nNow, we have this equal to the given polynomial \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). Let me write down that equation:\n\n\\[\na x^{4} + (-3a + b) x^{3} + (5a - 3b + c)x^{2} + (5b - 3c) x + 5c = x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25\n\\]\n\nWait a second, technically, the right-hand side doesn't show \\( x^2 \\) term, but technically, it's there with a coefficient of 0. That might be an important point. So, to properly set up the equations, I should compare coefficients for each degree.\n\nTherefore, the coefficients of corresponding powers must be equal. So, let's set them aside:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\):\n   \\( a = 1 \\) (Because RHS has 1 coefficient for \\( x^4 \\))\n\n2. Coefficient of \\( x^3 \\):\n   \\( -3a + b = -3 \\)\n\n3. Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\):\n   \\( 5a - 3b + c = 0 \\)\n\n4. Coefficient of \\( x \\):\n   \\( 5b - 3c = 15 \\)\n\n5. Constant term:\n   \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\nNow, that gives me a system of equations:\n\n1. \\( a = 1 \\)\n\n2. \\( -3a + b = -3 \\)\n\n3. \\( 5a - 3b + c = 0 \\)\n\n4. \\( 5b - 3c = 15 \\)\n\n5. \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\nAlright, let's solve this step by step.\n\nStarting with equation 1: \\( a = 1 \\). That\u2019s straightforward.\n\nMoving to equation 5: \\( 5c = -25 \\). Dividing both sides by 5, we get \\( c = -5 \\). So that gives us the value of \\( c \\).\n\nNow, let's plug \\( c = -5 \\) into equation 4: \\( 5b - 3c = 15 \\). Substituting:\n\n\\( 5b - 3*(-5) = 15 \\)\n\nCalculates to:\n\n\\( 5b + 15 = 15 \\)\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides: \\( 5b = 0 \\), so \\( b = 0 \\).\n\nOkay, now we have \\( b = 0 \\) and \\( c = -5 \\). Let's plug \\( a = 1 \\) into equation 2 to get \\( b \\). Wait, \\( a = 1 \\) and equation 2 is \\( -3a + b = -3 \\):\n\nSo, substituting \\( a = 1 \\):\n\n\\( -3(1) + b = -3 \\)\n\\( -3 + b = -3 \\)\nAdding 3 to both sides: \\( b = 0 \\). Okay, that matches the result from equation 4. Good, no contradictions there.\n\nNow, let's check equation 3: \\( 5a - 3b + c = 0 \\)\n\nWe know \\( a=1 \\), \\( b=0 \\), and \\( c=-5 \\):\n\n\\( 5(1) - 3(0) + (-5) = 5 - 0 -5 = 0 \\). Exactly, so equation 3 is satisfied.\n\nThus, all equations are consistent, and we have our values:\n\n\\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), \\( c = -5 \\)\n\nSo, putting it all together, the quadratic polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is:\n\n\\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = 1x^2 + 0x -5 = x^2 -5 \\)\n\nWait, hold on a moment. Let me just verify that to make sure we don't have a mistake.\n\nLet me compute \\( (x^2 - 3x +5)(x^2 -5) \\) and see if it equals \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\): that's \\( x^4 -5x^2 \\)\n\nNext, multiply \\( -3x \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\): that's \\( -3x^3 +15x \\)\n\nThen, multiply \\(5 \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\): that's \\( 5x^2 -25 \\)\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n\\( x^4 -5x^2 -3x^3 +15x +5x^2 -25 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- \\( x^4 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 \\)\n- \\( (-5x^2 +5x^2) = 0x^2 \\)\n- \\(15x \\)\n- \\( -25 \\)\n\nSo, the result is \\( x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25 \\). Which simplifies to \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\), which is exactly the polynomial we wanted. Perfect, so our solution is correct.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe we can perform polynomial long division as another method to see if \\( (x^2 - 3x +5) \\) divides into \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\) evenly, giving us \\( p(x) \\) as a quadratic.\n\nSo, if I perform \\( \\frac{x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25}{x^2 -3x +5} \\), the result should be \\( x^2 +0x -5 \\), which is \\( x^2 -5 \\).\n\nLet me set up the division:\n\nDivide \\( x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25 \\) by \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\).\n\n1. How many times does \\( x^2 \\) go into \\( x^4 \\)? It's \\( x^2 \\). Multiply \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\), which is \\( x^4 -3x^3 +5x^2 \\).\n\n2. Subtract this from the dividend:\n\n\\( (x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25) - (x^4 -3x^3 +5x^2) = 0x^4 +0x^3 -5x^2 +15x -25 \\)\n\n3. Now, bring down the next terms\u2014but here, all the coefficients are there, so move on.\n\n4. How many times does \\( x^2 \\) go into \\( -5x^2 \\)? It's \\(-5\\). Multiply \\( -5 \\) by \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\), which is \\( -5x^2 +15x -25 \\).\n\n5. Subtract this from the current dividend:\n\n\\( (-5x^2 +15x -25) - (-5x^2 +15x -25) = 0x^2 +0x +0 \\)\n\nSo, no remainder, which is perfect, and the quotient is \\( x^2 -5 \\), which again matches our previous result. So it's double-checked.\n\nAlternatively, if I am unsure, maybe I can try plugging in some values to see if both sides are equal.\n\nFor instance, let\u2019s pick x = 1.\n\nCompute LHS: \\( (1^2 -3*1 +5)(1^2 -5) = (1 -3 +5)(1 -5) = (3)(-4) = -12 \\)\n\nCompute RHS: \\(1^4 -3*1^3 +15*1 -25 =1 -3 +15 -25= (1 -3) + (15 -25) = (-2) + (-10)= -12 \\). So that works.\n\nLet me try another value, say x=2.\n\nCompute LHS: \\( (4 -6 +5)(4 -5)= (3)(-1)= -3 \\)\n\nCompute RHS: 16 -24 +30 -25= (16-24) + (30-25)= (-8)+(5)= -3. That works too.\n\nHow about x=0? Let me see.\n\nLHS: \\( (0 -0 +5)(0 -5)=5*(-5)= -25 \\)\n\nRHS: 0 +0 +0 -25= -25. That matches as well.\n\nAnother test at x= -1.\n\nLHS: (1 +3 +5)(1 -5)=9*(-4)= -36\n\nRHS: 1 +3 + (-15) -25=1 +3 -15 -25= 4 -40= -36. Perfect.\n\nSo, all tests are passing, confirming that our polynomial \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\nIs there another way to approach",

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I know that \\( p(x) \\) must be a polynomial because both \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) \\) and the result are polynomials. So, if I have a polynomial multiplied by a quadratic to get a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, that means \\( p(x) \\) must be a quadratic as well. Because if you multiply a quadratic by a quadratic, the highest degree term is 4. So, that suggests \\( p(x) \\) is a quadratic polynomial. \n\nLet me write that down. So, let me denote \\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants that I need to find. Got that.\n\nNow, the equation is \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). My task is to expand the left-hand side and then equate the coefficients with the right-hand side to find \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nSo, I'm going to proceed to expand \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c) \\).\n\nLet me recall that polynomial multiplication is done term by term. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and then like terms are combined.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n1. Multiply \\( x^2 \\) from the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\( x^2 \\cdot ax^2 = a x^{2+2} = a x^4 \\)\n   - \\( x^2 \\cdot bx = b x^{2+1} = b x^3 \\)\n   - \\( x^2 \\cdot c = c x^2 \\)\n\n2. Multiply \\( -3x \\) from the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\( -3x \\cdot ax^2 = -3a x^{1+2} = -3a x^3 \\)\n   - \\( -3x \\cdot bx = -3b x^{1+1} = -3b x^2 \\)\n   - \\( -3x \\cdot c = -3c x \\)\n\n3. Multiply \\( 5 \\) from the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\( 5 \\cdot ax^2 = 5a x^2 \\)\n   - \\( 5 \\cdot bx = 5b x \\)\n   - \\( 5 \\cdot c = 5c \\)\n\nNow, let me add up all these terms:\n\n- The \\( x^4 \\) term: \\( a x^4 \\)\n- The \\( x^3 \\) terms: \\( b x^3 - 3a x^3 \\) which combines to \\( (b - 3a) x^3 \\)\n- The \\( x^2 \\) terms: \\( c x^2 - 3b x^2 + 5a x^2 \\) which combines to \\( (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 \\)\n- The \\( x \\) terms: \\( -3c x + 5b x \\) which combines to \\( (-3c + 5b) x \\)\n- The constant term is \\( 5c \\ )\n\nSo, putting it all together, the expanded left-hand side becomes:\n\\( a x^4 + (b - 3a) x^3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c \\)\n\nNow, this must equal the right-hand side, which is \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). \n\nSo, let's write out the equation:\n\n\\[\na x^4 + (b - 3a) x^3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c = x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25\n\\]\n\nWait, hold on. When writing polynomials, the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) in the right-hand side is zero because there's no \\( x^2 \\) term. So I added \\( 0x^2 \\) to represent that. Similarly, the constants are 15 for \\( x \\) and -25 as the constant term.\n\nNow, since two polynomials are equal if and only if their corresponding coefficients of like terms are equal. So, let's set up equations for each coefficient:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\):\n   \\( a = 1 \\)\n\n2. Coefficient of \\( x^3 \\):\n   \\( b - 3a = -3 \\)\n\n3.

Okay, that's consistent.\n\nFinally, equation 5:\n\\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\\( c = -5 \\)\nWhich is the same result as above.\n\nSo, all equations are consistent, and we've got \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), \\( c = -5 \\).\n\nTherefore, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is:\n\n\\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = 1x^2 + 0x -5 = x^2 -5 \\)\n\nWait a minute, so \\( p(x) \\) is \\( x^2 - 5 \\)? Let me verify that.\n\nLet me multiply \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) \\) by \\( (x^2 -5) \\):\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 \\cdot x^2 = x^4 \\)\n\n\\( x^2 \\cdot (-5) = -5x^2 \\)\n\nThen, \\( -3x \\cdot x^2 = -3x^3 \\)\n\n\\( -3x \\cdot (-5) = 15x \\)\n\nThen, \\( 5 \\cdot x^2 = 5x^2 \\)\n\n\\( 5 \\cdot (-5) = -25 \\)\n\nNow, let me add all these together:\n\n- \\( x^4 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 \\)\n- \\( -5x^2 + 5x^2 = 0x^2 \\)\n- \\( 15x \\)\n- \\( -25 \\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x -25 \\), which is exactly the given polynomial.\n\nSo, indeed, \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\) is the correct polynomial.\n\nBut, just to double-check, maybe do the multiplication in a different way, maybe vertically.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n      x^2 - 3x + 5\n    *    x^2 - 5\n    ---------------\nMultiply each term:\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 -5 \\) by 5: 5*(x^2 -5) = 5x^2 -25\n\nThen, multiply \\( x^2 -5 \\) by (-3x): -3x*(x^2 -5) = -3x^3 +15x\n\nThen, multiply \\( x^2 -5 \\) by x^2: x^2*(x^2 -5) = x^4 -5x^2\n\nNow, add them all up:\n\nFirst term: x^4 -5x^2\nSecond term: -3x^3 +15x\nThird term: 5x^2 -25\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx^4: 1x^4\nx^3: -3x^3\nx^2: -5x^2 +5x^2 = 0\nx terms: 15x\nconstants: -25\n\nSo altogether:\nx^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 which matches.\n\nSo yeah, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use polynomial division? Let me think.\n\nIf I have \\( (x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25) \\) divided by \\( (x^2 -3x +5) \\), I should get \\( p(x) \\). Maybe checking through polynomial division.\n\nSo, dividing \\( x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25 \\) by \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\). Hmm.\n\nSet it up like polynomial long division:\n\nDividing \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 +15x -25 \\) by \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\)\n\nFirst term: \\( x^4 \\) divided by \\( x^2 \\) gives \\( x^2 \\).

Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if I have two polynomials multiplied together resulting in another polynomial, I can use polynomial division to find one polynomial if I know the other. In this case, I have the divisor (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) and the dividend is the result, which is x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25. So, I guess I need to divide x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25 by (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) to get p(x).\n\nLet me write this out: p(x) = (x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25) divided by (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5). Dividing polynomials usually involves polynomial long division. I've heard of this before; it's similar to dividing numbers, but with polynomials. I need to make sure I line up the terms properly.\n\nFirst, let me write both polynomials with their degrees in order. The dividend is a quartic (degree 4), and the divisor is a quadratic (degree 2). So, in long division, the divisor goes into the dividend.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2003_______________\nx\u00b2 - 3x + 5 ) x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25\n\nWait, I notice that in the dividend, there's no x\u00b2 term. So I should insert a placeholder with coefficient zero to make it easier. So, the dividend becomes x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nNow, I'll start the division.\n\nFirst term: x\u2074 divided by x\u00b2 is x\u00b2. So, the first term of the quotient is x\u00b2.\n\nMultiply the entire divisor by x\u00b2: x\u00b2*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2.\n\nSubtract this from the dividend:\n\n(x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25) - (x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2) =\n\nx\u2074 - x\u2074 = 0\n\n-3x\u00b3 - (-3x\u00b3) = 0\n\n0x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 = -5x\u00b2\n\n15x remains.\n\n-25 remains.\n\nSo now, the new polynomial is -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nBring down the terms, but since we've subtracted completely, the next step is to divide this new polynomial by the divisor.\n\nNext term: -5x\u00b2 divided by x\u00b2 is -5.\n\nMultiply the divisor by -5: -5*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nSubtract this from the current polynomial:\n\n(-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) - (-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) = 0\n\nSo, there's no remainder.\n\nSo, adding the two terms, x\u00b2 and -5, gives the quotient as x\u00b2 -5.\n\nTherefore, p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\nLet me check if that's correct. Multiply p(x) by (x\u00b2 -3x +5) and see if we get x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25.\n\nWell, (x\u00b2 -5)(x\u00b2 -3x +5).\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nx\u00b2*(x\u00b2) = x\u2074\n\nx\u00b2*(-3x) = -3x\u00b3\n\nx\u00b2*5 =5x\u00b2\n\n-5*(x\u00b2) = -5x\u00b2\n\n-5*(-3x)=15x\n\n-5*5 = -25\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx\u2074\n\n-3x\u00b3\n\n5x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 =0x\u00b2\n\n15x\n\n-25\n\nSo, we get x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 +0x\u00b2 +15x -25, which is equal to the given dividend x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +0x\u00b2 +15x -25. That checks out. So p(x) is indeed x\u00b2 -5. Cool.\n\nWait, let me recap the division steps because I want to make sure I didn't make any mistake there.\n\n1. Checked if I have all the missing terms with zero coefficients, which I did.\n\n2. First term: x\u2074 divided by x\u00b2 is x\u00b2. Multiply divisor by x\u00b2 gives x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2.\n\n3. Subtracted that, got 0 for x\u2074 and x\u00b3, -5x\u00b2 remains because 0x\u00b2 was there and 5x\u00b2 was subtracted.\n\n4. Then, next term is -5x\u00b2 /x\u00b2 is -5. Multiply divisor by -5, which is -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\n5. Subtract that from the current -5x\u00b2 +15x -25, and everything cancels out, remainder zero.\n\nSo, quotient is x\u00b2 -5. Therefore, p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\nI was a bit nervous when subtracting the polynomials, but breaking it down step by step seems to hold. Let me just visualize the multiplication again:\n\n(x\u00b2 -5)(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = x\u00b2*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) -5*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 +15x -25. As you can see, 5x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 cancels, and then you're left with x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25, which is exactly the given polynomial.\n\nSo, yeah, I think I'm confident that p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25\\), we perform polynomial long division of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n1. **Set up the division**: Divide \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n2. **First term**: \\( x^4 \\) divided by \\( x^2 \\) gives \\( x^2 \\).\n3. **Multiply and subtract**: Multiply \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) to get \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).

Hmm, interesting. I'm going to need to figure out what p(x) is. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that if I have two polynomials multiplied together and that their product is given, I can find the unknown polynomial by division. So p(x) must be the result when I divide x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25 by x\u00b2 - 3x + 5. That makes sense because polynomial division is like the opposite of multiplication. So I can set this up as a long division problem.\n\nAlright, let me write down the division. The dividend is x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 + 15x - 25, wait, why 0x\u00b2? Oh, because in the original polynomial x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25, the x\u00b2 term is missing. So I need to include a zero coefficient for that term to make the division accurate. Otherwise, I might misalign terms later on.\n\nSo, the divisor is x\u00b2 - 3x + 5. Let's set up the long division: \n\nWe start by dividing the first term of the dividend, which is x\u2074, by the first term of the divisor, which is x\u00b2. That gives x\u00b2. So, the first term of the quotient is x\u00b2. Now, multiply the entire divisor by x\u00b2 to get x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 5x\u00b2. \n\nSubtracting this from the dividend, we have:\n\n(x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 + 15x - 25) minus (x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 5x\u00b2) equals 0x\u2074 + 0x\u00b3 -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nSo now, the new polynomial to work with is -5x\u00b2 +15x -25. Now, we take the first term of this, which is -5x\u00b2, and divide it by the first term of the divisor, which is x\u00b2. That gives us -5. So, the next term in the quotient is -5.\n\nMultiply the divisor by -5: -5x\u00b2 +15x -25. Subtract that from our current polynomial:\n\n(-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) minus (-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) equals 0x\u00b2 +0x +0.\n\nOh, wow, that subtracted perfectly with no remainder. So putting it all together, the quotient is x\u00b2 -5, and the remainder is zero, which is exactly what we needed. So p(x) must be x\u00b2 -5.\n\nBut wait, hold on a second. Let me just verify that I did everything correctly because sometimes math can be tricky. So, we constructed p(x) as x\u00b2 -5 and multiplied it by (x\u00b2 -3x +5) to see if we get the original polynomial.\n\nLet me do that multiplication step by step:\n\n(x\u00b2 -5)(x\u00b2 -3x +5). Let's distribute each term:\n\nFirst, x\u00b2*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2.\n\nThen, -5*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nNow, add those two results together:\n\nx\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-5x\u00b2 +5x\u00b2 cancels out, so 0x\u00b2. Then, we have x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Which is exactly the right-hand side of the equation given. That checks out.\n\nSo yes, p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25\\), we need to perform polynomial division of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n1. **Set up the division**: The dividend is \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25 \\) (including a placeholder for the missing \\( x^2 \\) term) and the divisor is \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n2. **First term of the quotient**: Divide the first term of the dividend \\( x^4 \\) by the first term of the divisor \\( x^2 \\), giving \\( x^2 \\).\n\n3. **Multiply and subtract**: Multiply the entire divisor by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).

It's similar to long division with numbers. So, I can start by writing it out step by step. First, I need to divide \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x -25 \\) (since there's no \\( x^2 \\) term) by \\( x^2 - 3x +5 \\).\n\nLet me set it up:\n\nDividend: \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x -25 \\)\nDivisor: \\( x^2 - 3x +5 \\)\n\nI start by dividing the leading term of the dividend \\( x^4 \\) by the leading term of the divisor \\( x^2 \\).

I divide the leading term \\( -5x^2 \\) by the leading term of the divisor \\( x^2 \\), which gives me \\( -5 \\).

I need to divide \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\). Let me write down the dividend and the divisor.\n\nDividing \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\). I notice that for clarity, I added a placeholder term \\( 0x^2 \\) for the missing \\( x^2 \\) term in the dividend. That way, I can systematically perform the division.\n\nOkay, starting with the first term of the dividend, \\( x^4 \\), and dividing it by the first term of the divisor, \\( x^2 \\). That gives me \\( x^2 \\). So, \\( x^2 \\) is the first term of the quotient \\( p(x) \\).\n\nNow, I multiply the entire divisor \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) which gives \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).\n\nNext, I subtract this result from the original dividend:\n\n\\( (x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25) - (x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2) \\)\n\nSubtracting term by term:\n\n- \\( x^4 - x^4 = 0 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 - (-3x^3) = 0 \\)\n- \\( 0x^2 - 5x^2 = -5x^2 \\)\n- \\( 15x - 0 = 15x \\)\n- \\( -25 - 0 = -25 \\)\n\nSo, the new polynomial after subtraction is \\( -5x^2 + 15x -25 \\).\n\nNow, I repeat the process with this new polynomial. Divide the first term \\( -5x^2 \\) by the first term of the divisor \\( x^2 \\), which gives me \\( -5 \\). So, the next term of the quotient is \\( -5 \\).\n\nNow, multiply the entire divisor by \\( -5 \\):\n\n\\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) * (-5) = -5x^2 + 15x -25 \\).\n\nSubtracting this from the previous remainder:\n\n\\( (-5x^2 +15x -25 ) - (-5x^2 +15x -25 ) \\)\n\nSubtracting term by term:\n\n- \\( -5x^2 - (-5x^2) = 0 \\)\n- \\( 15x -15x = 0 \\)\n- \\( -25 - (-25) =0 \\)\n\nSo, the remainder is 0.\n\nTherefore, the division is exact, and the quotient is the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) which we found through division. The quotient started as \\( x^2 \\) and then became \\( x^2 -5 \\) after the next term.\n\nSo, putting it all together, \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\).\n\nWait, let me verify this. If I multiply \\( (x^2 -3x +5) \\) by \\( (x^2 -5) \\), do I get \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\)?\n\nMultiplying \\( x^2 * x^2 = x^4 \\).\nThen, \\( x^2 * (-5) = -5x^2 \\).\nNext, \\( -3x * x^2 = -3x^3 \\).\nThen, \\( -3x * (-5) = 15x \\).\nNow, \\(5* x^2 =5x^2\\).\nThen,5* (-5) = -25.\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n- \\( x^4 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 \\)\n- \\( -5x^2 +5x^2 = 0x^2 \\)\n- \\( +15x \\)\n- \\( -25 \\)\n\nSo, the product is \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\), which is exactly what was given. Therefore, the division was correct, and p(x) is indeed \\( x^2 -5 \\).\n\nAnother way I thought about this problem is by factoring. I know that if we have \\( (x^2 -3x +5)p(x) = x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\), maybe we can factor the right-hand side. Sometimes factoring can reveal the structure needed.\n\nLet me try to factor \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\). Hmm, factoring quartic polynomials can be tricky, but maybe it's a product of quadratics or something. Alternatively, perhaps it can be factored as the product of \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\) and another quadratic. Let me check.\n\nLet\u2019s assume \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 = (x^2 -3x +5)(px^2 + qx + r) \\). If I can find p, q, r such that this holds, then that will help me get p(x). Alternatively, p is the quadratic we just found, but to see whether this works.\n\nMultiplying out the right-hand side:\n\n\\( (x^2 -3x +5)(px^2 + qx + r) \\)\n= \\( x^2(px^2 + qx + r) -3x(px^2 + qx + r) + 5(px^2 + qx + r) \\)\n= \\( px^4 + qx^3 + rx^2 -3px^3 -3qx^2 -3rx +5px^2 +5qx +5r \\)\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\n- \\( x^4: p \\)\n- \\( x^3: q -3p \\)\n- \\( x^2: r -3q +5p \\)\n- \\( x: -3r +5q \\)\n- Constant term: 5r\n\nNow, the left-hand side is \\( x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25 \\). So, setting up equations by equating coefficients:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\): p =1\n2. Coefficient of \\( x^3 \\): q -3p = -3\n3. Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\): r -3q +5p =0\n4. Coefficient of \\( x \\): -3r +5q =15\n5. Constant term: 5r = -25\n\nSo, let's solve these equations:\n\nFrom equation 1: p =1\n\nFrom equation 2: q -3(1) = -3 \u2192 q -3 = -3 \u2192 q=0\n\nFrom equation 5: 5r = -25 \u2192 r = -5\n\nNow, from equation 3: r -3q +5p = (-5) -0 +5(1) =0? Let's test:\n\nr -3q +5p = -5 -0 +5 =0, which is correct.\n\nAnd from equation 4: -3r +5q = -3(-5) + 0 =15, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, p=1, q=0, r=-5.\n\nTherefore, the quadratic factor is \\( x^2 +0x -5 =x^2 -5 \\). So, indeed, \\( p(x)=x^2 -5 \\). Therefore, factoring confirms the division result.\n\nAnother method I could consider is using synthetic division or other factoring techniques, but since both polynomial division and factoring lead me to the same result, I\u2019m confident that \\( p(x) =x^2 -5 \\).\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can graph both polynomials and see if their product makes sense, but graphing often isn't necessary if all the algebraic methods confirm the solution.\n\nAlternatively, I can plug in a value for x into both sides and verify.\n\nLet\u2019s pick x=1:\n\nCompute LHS: (1^2 -3*1 +5)*p(1) = (1 -3 +5)*p(1)=3*p(1)\nCompute RHS:1^4 -3*1^3 +15*1 -25 =1 -3 +15 -25= (1-3)= -2, (-2 +15)=13, (13-25)=-12. So RHS value at x=1 is -12.\nThus, 3*p(1)=-12, so p(1)= -4.\n\nNow, p(x)=x^2 -5, so p(1)=1 -5= -4. It matches.\n\nAnother test with x=2:\n\nLHS: (4 -6 +5)*p(2)= (3)*p(2)\nRHS:16 -24 +30 -25= (16-24)= -8, (-8+30)=22, (22-25)= -3. So RHS at x=2 is -3.\nTherefore, 3*p(2)= -3, so p(2)= -1.\n\nCompute p(2)= 4 -5= -1. That checks out.\n\nOne more test with x=0:\n\nLHS: (0 -0 +5)*p(0)=5*p(0)\nRHS:0 -0 +0 -25= -25. So, 5*p(0)= -25, p(0)= -5.\n\nCompute p(0)=0 -5= -5. That also works.\n\nSo, all my test points are satisfied, which adds more confidence that p(x)=x^2 -5 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way is to notice that the given polynomial x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 might be factorable into two quadratics, one of which is x^2 -3x +5, so if I can factor it, that gives me p(x).\n\nBut perhaps an even quicker check is to plug in x= something that makes p(x) zero or something, but maybe not necessary here since the previous thoroughness is sufficient.\n\nThinking through, am I making any incorrect assumptions? The original setup is a product of polynomials and getting the quotient by division, but since both polynomials have integer coefficients, it's likely to be with lesser chance of error. Moreover, synthetic division would be faster if I thought in terms of factoring in (x - a), but in this case, since it's a quadratic, it's a bit more involved.\n\nBut as I already confirmed with factoring by coefficient comparison, it's sufficient. So, I think I'm confident that p(x)=x\u00b2 -5 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, just one thing\u2014when I first thought of polynomial division, I said the process, but then I thought of factoring, so maybe someone might get confused whether the factoring is necessary or not.\n\nBut in this case, since the question is phrased as multiplying p(x) and (x\u00b2 -3x +5), so actually, it's possible to state that p(x) is equal to the division. Thus, either method works.\n\nBut perhaps factoring can be a method in cases when known factors are present. For example, if both the dividend and divisor had some common factor, but in this case, I don't think that's applicable.\n\nAnother thought: maybe sometimes polynomials can have multiple factors or roots, but in this case, since the divisor is quadratic, and having found the other quadratic factor, that's sufficient. And it's another good check that after multiplying the two quadratics, one of them being known, I get back the dividend.\n\nThus, all in all, I think I\u2019ve approached the problem in multiple ways, and all confirm that \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\), we need to perform polynomial division of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n1.

Hmm, okay. Let's see. I guess p(x) must be a polynomial as well, right? Because if I multiply (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) by p(x) and get a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, then p(x) has to be a quadratic (degree 2), since 2 (from x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) plus 2 (from p(x)) equals 4. That makes sense.\n\nSo, let me write p(x) as a general quadratic: p(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c. That seems like a good start because it covers all possibilities for a second-degree polynomial.\n\nNow, the equation given is (x\u00b2 - 3x +5)(ax\u00b2 + bx + c) = x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Okay, so if I multiply these two polynomials together, I should end up with that result. Therefore, I can expand the left-hand side and then set the coefficients equal to those on the right-hand side. Since the coefficients of corresponding powers of x must be equal for the two polynomials to be equal, I can set up equations and solve for a, b, and c.\n\nLet me go ahead and perform that multiplication. I'll multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.\n\nFirst, take x\u00b2 multiplied by each term in p(x):\n\n- x\u00b2 * ax\u00b2 = a x\u2074\n- x\u00b2 * bx = b x\u00b3\n- x\u00b2 * c = c x\u00b2\n\nThen, take -3x multiplied by each term in p(x):\n\n- -3x * ax\u00b2 = -3a x\u00b3\n- -3x * bx = -3b x\u00b2\n- -3x * c = -3c x\n\nNext, take +5 multiplied by each term in p(x):\n\n- 5 * ax\u00b2 = 5a x\u00b2\n- 5 * bx = 5b x\n- 5 * c = 5c\n\nNow, let's combine all those terms:\n\n= a x\u2074\n+ b x\u00b3 + c x\u00b2\n-3a x\u00b3 -3b x\u00b2 -3c x\n+5a x\u00b2 +5b x +5c\n\nNow, let's collect like terms:\n\n- x\u2074 term: a x\u2074\n- x\u00b3 terms: b x\u00b3 - 3a x\u00b3\n- x\u00b2 terms: c x\u00b2 -3b x\u00b2 +5a x\u00b2\n- x terms: -3c x +5b x\n- constant term: 5c\n\nSo, writing it all together:\n\n= a x\u2074 + (b - 3a) x\u00b3 + (c -3b +5a) x\u00b2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c\n\nNow, we know this is equal to x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. So, to find coefficients, let's set the coefficients equal for each power of x:\n\nFor x\u2074: a = 1\n\nFor x\u00b3: (b - 3a) = -3\n\nFor x\u00b2: (c - 3b +5a) = 0 (since there's no x\u00b2 term on the right side)\n\nFor x: (-3c +5b) = 15\n\nFor constant term: 5c = -25\n\nOkay, so that gives us a system of equations:\n\n1. a = 1\n\n2. b - 3a = -3\n\n3. c - 3b +5a = 0\n\n4. -3c +5b = 15\n\n5. 5c = -25\n\nAlright, let's solve these equations step by step starting from the first equation.\n\nEquation 1: a = 1. So, a is 1. That's straightforward.\n\nMoving to Equation 5: 5c = -25; so, divide both sides by 5, c = -25 / 5 = -5. So, c = -5.\n\nNow that we have a=1 and c=-5, let's plug into Equation 2: Equation 2 says b -3a = -3.\n\nSubstituting a=1, we get: b -3(1) = -3 => b -3 = -3 => b = 0\n\nWait, b = 0?\n\nLet me pause. Let me write down all these steps when plugging in:\n\nEquation 2: b -3a = -3\n\nWith a=1: b - 3(1) = -3 => b -3 = -3 => b = -3 +3 => b=0. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo, b=0. Okay, moving to Equation 3: c -3b +5a = 0.\n\nWe know c=-5, b=0, a=1, so:\n\n-5 -3(0) +5(1) = 0 => -5 +0 +5 = 0 => 0=0. Perfect, it holds.\n\nNow, let's move to Equation 4: -3c +5b = 15.\n\nPlug in c=-5, b=0:\n\n-3(-5)+5(0)=15 =>15 +0=15=>15=15. Also holds.\n\nHmm, so all the equations are consistent. So, we have a=1, b=0, c=-5.\n\nTherefore, the quadratic polynomial p(x)= ax\u00b2 +bx +c=1 x\u00b2 +0x -5 => x\u00b2 - 5.\n\nWait a second. Is that it? So, p(x)=x\u00b2 -5? Hmm. Let me verify.\n\nLet me multiply (x\u00b2 -3x +5) by (x\u00b2 -5) and see if I get the given quartic.\n\nSo, let's do that.\n\n(x\u00b2 -3x +5)(x\u00b2 -5). Let's compute term by term.\n\nFirst, x\u00b2 * x\u00b2 =x\u2074\n\nx\u00b2 * (-5)= -5x\u00b2\n\nThen, -3x *x\u00b2= -3x\u00b3\n\n-3x*(-5)=15x\n\nThen, +5* x\u00b2=5x\u00b2\n\n+5*(-5)= -25\n\nSo, combining all those:\n\nx\u2074 -5x\u00b2 -3x\u00b3 +15x +5x\u00b2 -25\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\nx\u2074 (only term)\n\n-3x\u00b3 (only term)\n\nThen, (-5x\u00b2 +5x\u00b2)=0x\u00b2\n\n15x (only term)\n\n-25 (constant term)\n\nSo, total polynomial is x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Which is exactly the given polynomial on the right-hand side.\n\nWow, that's perfect. So, my values of a=1, b=0, c=-5 result in p(x) = x\u00b2 -5, and this works.\n\nSo, therefore, p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\nWait, maybe I should write p(x)=x\u00b2 -5 to make sure it's correct.\n\nBut let me just double-check my multiplication:\n\n(x\u00b2 -3x +5)(x\u00b2 -5) = x\u2074 -5x\u00b2 -3x\u00b3 +15x +5x\u00b2 -25. The x\u00b2 terms cancel out, and the rest gives x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Yes, that's exactly what we needed. So, seems correct.\n\nSo, like I thought, when we had a=1, b=0, c=-5, everything worked out. So, yeah, p(x) is definitely x\u00b2 -5. I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, maybe I can notice if the polynomials could have been factored or had some factors canceled, but (x\u00b2 -3x +5) is not factorable over the reals, as discriminant is 9 -20 = -11 <0, so it can't be factored into real linear terms.\n\nAlso, the right-hand side, x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Let me see, does that factor? Maybe if we can factor it into (x\u00b2 -3x +5) multiplied by something else, which we just did, but I think it's more work than I need.\n\nGiven that when I multiplied (x\u00b2 -3x +5)*(x\u00b2 -5) I got the exact polynomial on the right, then p(x) must be x\u00b2 -5.\n\nI think that\u2019s solid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is p(x) = x\u00b2 -5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25\\), we assume \\( p(x) \\) is a quadratic polynomial of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\).\n\nExpanding \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c)\\) and combining like terms, we get:\n\\[\na x^4 + (b - 3a) x^3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c\n\\]\n\nWe compare this with the given polynomial \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) and set up the following system of equations by equating the coefficients of corresponding powers of \\( x \\):\n1. \\( a = 1 \\)\n2. \\( b - 3a = -3 \\)\n3. \\( c - 3b + 5a = 0 \\)\n4. \\( -3c + 5b = 15 \\)\n5. \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\nSolving these equations step by step:\n1. From \\( a = 1 \\), we have \\( a = 1 \\).\n2. From \\( 5c = -25 \\), we get \\( c = -5 \\).\n3. Substituting \\( a = 1 \\) into \\( b - 3a = -3 \\), we get \\( b = 0 \\).\n4. Verifying with equations 3 and 4, we find that they hold true with \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), and \\( c = -5 \\).\n\nThus, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is:\n\\[\np(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = x^2 - 5\n\\]\n\nTo verify, we multiply \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)(x^2 - 5)\\) and confirm it results in \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nTherefore, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>"

Hmm, alright, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that an even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in its domain, and an odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). That means, for \\( f \\), swapping the sign of the input doesn't change the output, but for \\( g \\), it flips the sign of the output when the input is negated.\n\nNow, the function in question is \\( f(g(x^3)) \\). I need to determine if this is even, odd, or neither. To check that, I should see if \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\) relates to \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) in a way that fits the definitions.\n\nLet me compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\). First, notice that \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\) because raising a negative to an odd power keeps it negative. So, inside the function \\( g \\), we have \\( g(-x^3) \\).\n\nSince \\( g \\) is an odd function, \\( g(-y) = -g(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). Let me substitute \\( y = x^3 \\), so \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).\n\nNow, substitute this back into the original expression: \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n\nSince \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-z) = f(z) \\) for any \\( z \\). Letting \\( z = g(x^3) \\), it follows that \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nPutting this all together, we have \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), which is \\( f(g(x^3)) \\). This means that the function \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\) satisfies \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), because \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n\nTherefore, by definition, \\( h(x) \\) is an even function.\n\nWait, did I skip any steps? Let me check again.\n\n1. Start with \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n2. Compute \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\).\n3. Simplify the inside: \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\), so \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n4. Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\), so \\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n5. Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n6. That is \\( f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n7. So, \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), which means \\( h \\) is even.\n\nYep, that all checks out. So, whether I cube \\( x \\), apply the odd function \\( g \\), which flips the sign, and then apply the even function \\( f \\), which doesn't care about the sign, results in the overall function being even.\n\nI don't think I made a mistake here. It makes sense because the composition essentially neutralizes the effect of the odd function because of the even function wrapping around it. So, the result is symmetric, hence even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1.

So, let's start by recalling some basic definitions to get a grip on this.\n\nAn even function satisfies the condition \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in its domain. On the other hand, an odd function meets the condition \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in its domain. Okay, so that's clear. Now, in this problem, we\u2019re dealing with compositions of functions, which can sometimes be tricky, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me establish what we know:\n\n1. \\( f(x) \\) is an even function. That means \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\).\n2. \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, so \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n3. We need to analyze the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) and determine if it's even, odd, or neither.\n\nAlright, let's tackle the composition step by step. Let me define a new function \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\) to make things clearer. The question is whether \\( h(-x) \\) equals \\( h(x) \\) (even), \\( -h(x) \\) (odd), or something else.\n\nSo, to figure out what kind of function \\( h(x) \\) is, let's compute \\( h(-x) \\) and see how it relates to \\( h(x) \\). Let's do that step by step.\n\nStart with \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\). Let's simplify the inner part first. \\( (-x)^3 \\) is equal to \\( -x^3 \\), right? Since when you raise a negative number to an odd power, it remains negative. So, \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\). Therefore, the expression becomes:\n\n\\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n\nNow, I remember that \\( g(x) \\) is odd, so substituting \\( -x^3 \\) into \\( g \\) should give us \\( -g(x^3) \\). Let's write that down:\n\n\\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for \\( h(-x) \\):\n\n\\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n\nHmm, so we have \\( f(-g(x^3)) \\) now. Here, \\( f(x) \\) is even. What happens when we plug in \\( -g(x^3) \\) into an even function?\n\nSince \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). So, if we let \\( y = g(x^3) \\), then:\n\n\\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nBut wait, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is exactly our original function \\( h(x) \\). So, substituting that back:\n\n\\( h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n\nSo, \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), which per the definitions, means that \\( h(x) \\) is even.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any steps or assumptions. Let's go step by step again.\n\n1. \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n2. To find if \\( h(-x) \\) equals \\( h(x) \\) or \\( -h(x) \\), compute \\( h(-x) \\):\n   - \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n3. Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\):\n   - \\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n4. Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n5. Thus, \\( h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n\nYes, everything checks out. So, each step holds. So, the composition \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\nWait another thought\u2014is the composition of an even and an odd function necessarily even or could it vary? Let's think.\n\nSuppose \\( f \\) is even and \\( g \\) is odd. Then, when you compose them, the inside function is odd (\\( g(x^3) \\). But since \\( x^3 \\) is also an odd function (because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\)), composing an odd function \\( g \\) with another odd function \\( x^3 \\) gives us \\( g(x^3) \\) as odd?\n\nWait, hold on: is \\( g(x^3) \\) even, odd, or neither?\n\nIf \\( g \\) is odd, then \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). So, let's compute \\( g((-x)^3) = g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\), because \\( g \\) is odd. So, \\( g(x^3) \\) is an odd function, because \\( g((-x)^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, the inner function \\( g(x^3) \\) is odd.\n\nSo, now, \\( f \\) maps this intermediate odd function. So, \\( h(x) = f \\) (something odd). Since \\( f \\) is even, how does it interact with an odd input?\n\nLet's note that even functions take care of the sign, so \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\). Therefore, no matter if the input to \\( f \\) is odd or not, \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\). So, even when the input is odd, you still get the same value as when you input the positive version.\n\nSo, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), leading to \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), as established before.\n\nBut hold on, let me consider specific examples to verify my conclusion because sometimes these properties can be counter-intuitive.\n\nSuppose \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\), which is odd. Then, computing \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\), which is \\( (x^3)^2 = x^6 \\). Is \\( x^6 \\) even? Yes, because any even power of \\( x \\) is an even function.\n\nAlternatively, take another even function, say \\( f(x) = \\cos(x) \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = \\sin(x) \\), which is odd. Then, \\( h(x) = \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\). Then, \\( h(-x) = \\cos(\\sin((-x)^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(-x^3)) = \\cos(-\\sin(x^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\), because cosine is an even function. Therefore, \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so it is even as well.\n\nBut wait, let me think if I can get an example where the composition is neither even nor odd. Let me see.\n\nSuppose \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x + x^3 \\). Is \\( g(x) \\) odd? Let's check \\( g(-x) = (-x) + (-x)^3 = -x - x^3 = - (x + x^3) = -g(x) \\), so yes, \\( g \\) is odd.\n\nThen \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) = (g(x^3))^2 = (x^3 + (x^3)^3)^2 = (x^3 + x^9)^2 \\). Let me test \\( h(-x) = (-x^3 + (-x^9))^2 = (-x^3 - x^9)^2 = (x^3 + x^9)^2 = h(x) \\). So, still, it's even. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need a different example where maybe \\( f \\) isn't just a power function. Let me take \\( f(x) = |x| \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\), which is odd. Then, \\( h(x) = |x^3| \\). Now, \\( |(-x)^3| = | -x^3 | = |x^3| \\), so \\( h(-x) = |x^3| = h(x) \\), which is still even.\n\nIs there a scenario where the composition would be odd?\n\nWait, for \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) to be odd, we need \\( f(g(-x^3)) = -f(g(x^3)) \\), but since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), so for the antipodal condition to hold, \\( f(g(-x^3)) = -f(g(x^3)) \\) meaning \\( f(-g(x^3)) = -f(g(x^3)) \\), which would only require that \\( f(-y) = -f(y) \\) for \\( y = g(x^3) \\), but since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\). Therefore, unless \\( f(y) \\) is also odd for all \\( y \\), the equality may not hold. But \\( f \\) is given as even, not odd.\n\nTherefore, in general, unless \\( f \\) is both even and odd, which is only possible if it's the zero function, it's impossible for the composition to be odd because \\( f \\) being even forces \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), making \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), hence even.\n\nTherefore, my earlier conclusion seems solid.\n\nSo, summarizing the steps:\n\n- Start with \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n- Compute \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n- Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).\n- Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n- Therefore, \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so \\( h(x) \\) is even.\n\nI think that checks out. I considered some specific examples, and in each case, the composition came out even. I also stepped through the general case again without seeing any contradictions, which supports my conclusion.\n\nSo, to wrap it up, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is an even function.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) ) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1. An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\).\n2. An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\nTo analyze the composition \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\), we compute \\( h(-x) \\):\n\n\\[\nh(-x) = f(g((-x)^3))\n\\]\n\nSince \\((-x)^3 = -x^3\\), we have:\n\n\\[\nh(-x) = f(g(-x^3))\n\\]\n\nBecause \\( g \\) is an odd function:\n\n\\[\ng(-x^3) = -g(x^3)\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\nh(-x) = f(-g(x^3))\n\\]\n\nSince \\( f \\) is an even function:\n\n\\[\nf(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3))\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\nh(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x)\n\\]\n\nThis shows that \\( h(x) \\) is even.

Hmm, okay, let's unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that even functions satisfy \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in their domain. Examples are things like \\( x^2 \\) or cosine functions. On the other hand, odd functions satisfy \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). Examples of odd functions include \\( x^3 \\) or sine functions.\n\nSo, we have \\( f \\) being even, \\( g \\) being odd. The composite function we're looking at is \\( f(g(x^3)) \\). Let me write this out: \\( f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nI need to figure out if this composite function is even, odd, or neither. To do that, I should check the definition of even and odd for composite functions. That is, I should find \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\) and compare it to \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) and see if it equals either \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) or \\( -f(g(x^3)) \\), or neither.\n\nLet's compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\).\n\nFirst, calculate \\( (-x)^3 \\). That's \\( -x^3 \\). So, we have \\( g(-x^3) \\).\n\nBut since \\( g \\) is an odd function, \\( g(-y) = -g(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). Let me substitute \\( y = x^3 \\) here. So, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, \\( f(g(-x^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n\nNow, since \\( f \\) is an even function, \\( f(-z) = f(z) \\) for any \\( z \\). Let me denote \\( z = g(x^3) \\), then \\( f(-z) = f(z) \\).\n\nSo, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). Putting it all together, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). Therefore, the function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) satisfies \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), which is the definition of an even function.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I started by evaluating \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\), which breaks down to \\( f(-g(x^3)) \\) because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\) and \\( g \\) is odd. Then, since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). So the composition is even. Hmm, seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can test it with specific examples to make sure.\n\nLet's take \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) (which is even) and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\) (which is odd). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = (x^3)^2 = x^6 \\). Is \\( x^6 \\) even or odd? Well, substituting \\( -x \\) gives \\( (-x)^6 = x^6 \\), so yes, it's even. So in this case, it's even.\n\nAnother example: Let \\( f(x) = \\cos(x) \\) (which is even) and \\( g(x) = \\sin(x) \\) (which is odd). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\). Let's check if this is even or odd. Compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = \\cos(\\sin((-x)^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(-x^3)) \\). Since \\( \\sin(-x^3) = -\\sin(x^3) \\) (because sine is odd), then \\( \\cos(-\\sin(x^3)) \\). Cosine is an even function, so \\( \\cos(-a) = \\cos(a) \\), so this becomes \\( \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\). Therefore, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), so this composite function is also even. Interesting.\n\nWait, is that always the case, regardless of the specific even and odd functions? Let me test another example. Maybe with \\( f(x) = x^4 \\) (even) and \\( g(x) = x^5 \\) (odd). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = (x^5)^4 = x^{20} \\), which is even because \\( (-x)^{20} = x^{20} \\). Seems okay.\n\nPerhaps an even function that's not just a power, and an odd function that isn't a power. Let's see, \\( f(x) = e^{x^2} \\) (which is even since \\( e^{(-x)^2} = e^{x^2} \\)) and \\( g(x) = \\sin(x) \\) (which is odd). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = e^{(\\sin(x^3))^2} \\). Let's check if this is even: Replace \\( x \\) with \\( -x \\) and see if equality holds.\n\n\\( f(g((-x)^3)) = e^{(\\sin((-x)^3))^2} = e^{(\\sin(-x^3))^2} \\). Since sine is odd, \\( \\sin(-x^3) = -\\sin(x^3) \\). So squaring it, \\( (-\\sin(x^3))^2 = (\\sin(x^3))^2 \\). Therefore, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = e^{(\\sin(x^3))^2} = f(g(x^3)) \\). So again it's even.\n\nHmm, seems that across the board it's even.\n\nAlternatively, let me try if \\( g(x) \\) isn't odd but even, just for testing. Wait, but in this problem, \\( g \\) is odd. So if I wouldn't get the right result? Anyway, in our problem \\( g \\) is odd, so that's consistent.\n\nLet me try another example where \\( f \\) is even, but \\( g \\) is different. Say \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), \\( g(x) = x^3 + x \\), which is odd because \\( g(-x) = -x^3 -x = -(x^3 + x) = -g(x) \\). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = (x^3 + x)^2 = x^6 + 2x^4 + x^2 \\). Test whether this is even: substitute \\( -x \\): \\( (-x)^6 + 2(-x)^4 + (-x)^2 = x^6 + 2x^4 + x^2 \\), which is the same as before. So yes, it's even.\n\nAlternatively, take a non-algebraic even function. Suppose \\( f(x) = |x| \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\), which is odd. Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = |g(x^3)| = |x^9| = |x|^9 \\). Wait, is that even or odd?\n\n\\( |x^9| = |x|^9 \\). Then evaluating at \\( -x \\): \\( |(-x)^9| = | -x^9 | = |x|^9 \\). So they are equal, so \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even again.\n\nWait, so in all these examples, it's even. So is there a reason why? Let's see:\n\n1. Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\n2. Then \\( g(x^3) \\) as is: for any \\( x \\), \\( g(x^3) \\) is... wait, it's not straightforwardly odd or even because \\( x^3 \\) is odd.\n\nWait, but if \\( g \\) is odd, then \\( g(x^3) \\) is still a function, right? Let me check if \\( g(x^3) \\) is even or odd. Let's consider \\( h(x) = g(x^3) \\). Is \\( h(-x) = -h(x) \\) or \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\)?\n\nCompute \\( h(-x) = g((-x)^3) = g(-x^3) \\). But since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). So \\( h(-x) = -g(x^3) = -h(x) \\). Therefore, \\( h(x) = g(x^3) \\) is an odd function.\n\nSo in reality, after the substitution, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) becomes \\( f(h(x)) \\) where \\( h(x) \\) is odd.\n\nNow, since \\( f \\) is even, what happens when we plug an odd function into an even function? Let me recall:\n\nIf \\( h(x) \\) is odd, \\( h(-x) = -h(x) \\). So \\( f(h(-x)) = f(-h(x)) \\). Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-h(x)) = f(h(x)) \\). Therefore, \\( f(h(-x)) = f(h(x)) \\), which means \\( f \\circ h \\) is even, because \\( (f \\circ h)(-x) = (f \\circ h)(x) \\).\n\nTherefore, yes, the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it:\n\nLet me denote \\( y = x^3 \\). Then \\( f(g(y)) \\). Since \\( y = x^3 \\), which has a power of 3. So if I replace \\( x \\) with \\( -x \\), \\( y \\) becomes \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\). So then \\( f(g(-x^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\) because \\( g \\) is odd. And since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). Hence, \\( f(g(x^3)) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\), so the function is even.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the specific even and odd functions chosen, as long as \\( f \\) is even and \\( g \\) is odd, the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) ends up being even.\n\nIs there a situation when this might not hold? Maybe if \\( f \\) or \\( g \\) are not injective or something? Hmm, but the property doesn't depend on injectivity or surjectivity because it's based solely on the functional equations \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) and \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). So since these properties hold for all \\( x \\), regardless of specific behavior, then the composition will always satisfy \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\) making it even.\n\nTherefore, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is an even function.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1. **Properties of Even and Odd Functions**:\n   - An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\).\n   - An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the Composite Function**:\n   - We need to check if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even or odd.\n   - Consider \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\).

        "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c><\uff5cUser\uff5c>Please solve the following mathematical problem, placing your final answer within \\boxed{}:\nIf $f(x)$ is an even function and $g(x)$ is an odd function, find if $f(g(x^3))$ is even, odd, or neither.\n\nEnter \"odd\", \"even\", or \"neither\".<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, let's see. I have this math problem here: If f(x) is an even function and g(x) is an odd function, find if f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, odd, or neither. Hmm, I remember that even and odd functions have specific properties, so maybe I can use those to figure it out.\n\nFirst off, let's recall what even and odd functions are. An even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain. So, if I plug in -x, it's the same as plugging in x. Classic examples are functions like f(x) = x\u00b2 or cosine functions.\n\nOn the other hand, an odd function satisfies g(-x) = -g(x). So, flipping the sign of x flips the sign of the output. Examples include g(x) = x\u00b3 or sine functions.\n\nAlright, so in this problem, f is even, g is odd. I need to compute whether the composition f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, odd, or neither. Let me think through the composition step by step.\n\nLet me denote h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)). So, h(x) is the composition of f(g(x\u00b3)). To determine if h(x) is even, odd, or neither, I should check h(-x).\n\nLet me compute h(-x):\n\nh(-x) = f(g((-x)\u00b3)).\n\nFirst, let's process inner function g. Since -x is raised to the 3rd power, (-x)\u00b3 = -x\u00b3. So, the argument becomes -x\u00b3. Then, since g is odd, g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). So, substituting back into h(-x), we have:\n\nh(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n\nNow, since f is even, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)). Let me note that down.\n\nTherefore, h(-x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = h(x). \n\nWait, so h(-x) = h(x). That means h(x) is even because it satisfies the definition of an even function, right? Because plugging in -x doesn't change the value of h(x).\n\nLet me double-check that step:\n\n1. Start with h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n2. To find if it's even or odd, evaluate h(-x).\n3. Compute g(-x\u00b3). Since g is odd, g(-y) = -g(y). So, let y = x\u00b3, then g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3).\n4. Thus, h(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n5. Since f is even, f(-z) = f(z) for any z. Therefore, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n6. Thus, h(-x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = h(x).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, h(-x) = h(x), which is exactly the condition for h(x) being even. Therefore, f(g(x\u00b3)) is an even function.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any steps or misapply the properties. Hmm.\n\nAnother way to think about it: suppose f(x) is even, so f(-y) = f(y). g is odd, so g(-z) = -g(z). So, plugging into h(-x):\n\nh(-x) = f(g((-x)\u00b3)) = f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-g(x\u00b3)) because g is odd. Then, using f is even, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = h(x). So yes, h(-x) = h(x), so h is even.\n\nAlternatively, I can use substitutions:\n\nLet\u2019s consider substituting x with -x in h(x):\n\nh(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(-x^3)) because (-x)^3 is -x^3.\n\nSince g is odd, g(-x^3) = -g(x^3). Plugging that in, h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)).\n\nBut f is even, so f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)).\n\nBut f(g(x^3)) is exactly h(x). So, h(-x) = h(x), so h is even.\n\nTherefore, regardless of specific functions f and g, as long as f is even and g is odd, the composition f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nLet me test with actual functions to verify.\n\nSuppose f(x) = x\u00b2 (which is even) and g(x) = x\u00b3 (which is odd). Then h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = (x\u00b3)^3 = x^9.\n\nWait, is x^9 even or odd? Well, x^9 is an odd function because (-x)^9 = -x^9. So, wait, h(x) = x^9 is odd, which contradicts our earlier conclusion that it's even.\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem right. Did I make an error somewhere?\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me compute h(x) in this case.\n\nf(x) = x\u00b2, g(x) = x\u00b3.\n\nThen h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = f((x\u00b3)^3) = f(x^9) = (x^9)^2 = x^18.\n\nAh, that's even because (-x)^18 = x^18. So h(-x) = (-x)^18 = x^18 = h(x). So, in this case, h(x) is even.\n\nBut earlier, I thought h(x) = x^9, which is odd, but actually, wait, no:\n\nNo, because in the composition f(g(x\u00b3)), with f(x) = x\u00b2, which is even, and g(x\u00b3) is x^9, which is an odd function. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) is (x^9)\u00b2 = x^{18}. So, yes, it's even.\n\nWait, but if I had g(x) = x\u00b3, f(x) = x, then h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = x\u00b3, which is odd. Hmm, but in that case, f is neither even nor odd necessarily? Wait, no.\n\nWait, is f(x) = x considered even or odd? f(-x) = -x = -f(x), so yes, f(x) = x is odd. So in that example, f is odd, right.\n\nBut in our original problem, f is even. So, in my first example, with f being x\u00b2 and g being x\u00b3: f is even, g is odd. So then, h is f(g(x\u00b3)) is x^18, which is even. So that works.\n\nBut wait, if f is the identity function, which is odd, and g is odd, then f(g(x\u00b3)) would be g(x\u00b3), which, if g is odd, would make it odd cubed, which is also odd. So, we can clearly see that the composition's parity depends on the functions involved.\n\nWait, but in our problem, f is even, g is odd.\n\nWait, let me take another example to check.\n\nSuppose f(x) = x^4, which is even. g(x) = x^5, which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) would be (x^5)^3)^4? Wait, no. Wait, no, wait, g(x\u00b3) is x\u00b3^5? Wait, no: Hold on, no. If g(x) = x^5, then g(x\u00b3) = (x\u00b3)^5 = x^{15}.\n\nThen, f(g(x\u00b3)) = f(x^{15}) = (x^{15})^4 = x^{60}. Which is even, because (-x)^60 = x^60. So yes, h(x) = x^{60} is even.\n\nAlternatively, if I took g(x) = x (odd) and f(x) = x\u00b2 (even). Then f(g(x\u00b3)) is (g(x\u00b3))^2 = (x\u00b3)^2 = x^6, which is even. So that works too.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake before when thinking of f(x) = x being odd, but in the problem, f is specifically even. So, in that case, if I have f(x) = x, which is odd, but in our problem, f is even, so we have to use f preserving the symmetry, making the composition even.\n\nAlternatively, what if f is a constant function? Like f(x) = 2, which is even? Wait, f(-x) = 2 = f(x), so yes, constant function is even. Then g(x) is odd, say g(x) = x\u00b3. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) = f(x^9) = 2, which is even because h(-x) = 2 = h(x). So yeah, that still holds.\n\nOkay, so testing multiple cases, and in all of them, f(g(x\u00b3)) is even when f is even and g is odd. So, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, I think the conclusion is that h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) is even under the given conditions.\n\nWait, but just to ensure, what if f is even, g is odd, but, say, f is even like x\u00b2, and g is odd like x, so f(g(x\u00b3)) = (x\u00b3)^2 = x^6, which is even. Alternatively, if g was an odd function but not x\u00b3, say, sin(x). Then f(g(x\u00b3)) = (sin(x\u00b3))\u00b2, which is still even because [sin(-x\u00b3)]\u00b2 = [ - sin(x\u00b3) ]\u00b2 = [sin(x\u00b3)]\u00b2, which is equal to (sin(x\u00b3))\u00b2. So, yeah, squaring it would make it even regardless. That also makes sense because f is even, so whatever comes out of g is squared.\n\nSo, seems solid.\n\nAnother angle: If f is even, then f(-y) = f(y). So, for h(x), h(-x) = f(g(-x\u00b3)).\n\nSince g is odd, g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3).\n\nTherefore:\n\nh(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n\nBecause f is even, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nWhich is h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nTherefore, h(-x) = h(x), which is the definition of even.\n\nYep, so that's consistent.\n\nSo, mathematically, no mistake in the reasoning.\n\nPerhaps my initial confusion came when choosing a function g for h(x) = g(x\u00b3), but when f is not necessarily even, but f is applied to g(x\u00b3), then the behavior is different. But in our problem, f is even, so f(g(x\u00b3)) ends up being even.\n\nHence, I feel confident the answer is even.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\nFirst, recall the definitions:\n- An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n- An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\nTo determine the nature of \\( f(g(x^3)) \\), we evaluate it at \\( -x \\):\n\n1.

Recognize that \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is the original function \\( h(x) \\):\n   \\[\n   h(-x) = h(x)\n   \\]\n\nThus, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) satisfies the condition for being an even function.

Hmm. Let's see. First, I remember that an even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x, and an odd function satisfies f(-x) = -f(x) for all x.\n\nWait, in this case, f(x) is even and g(x) is odd. So I need to see what happens when I compose these functions with x\u00b3 inside. Let me think step by step.\n\nLet me denote h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)). To determine if h(x) is even, odd, or neither, I should check h(-x) and see how it relates to h(x).\n\nSo, h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)). Let me compute (-x)^3 first. Since (-x)^3 = -x\u00b3, that simplifies to -x\u00b3. So h(-x) becomes f(g(-x\u00b3)).\n\nBut since g is an odd function, g(-y) = -g(y) for any y. Let me let y = x\u00b3, then g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). So substituting back, we have h(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n\nNow, f is an even function, so f(-z) = f(z) for any z. Let me set z = g(x\u00b3), so f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)). Therefore, h(-x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = h(x).\n\nSince h(-x) = h(x), that means h(x) is an even function. So f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nWait, let me go over that again to make sure I didn't skip a step. So f is even, so applying f to something negative is the same as applying f to the positive version. Therefore, h(-x) becomes f of g(-x\u00b3) which is f(g(-x\u00b3)). Since g is odd, g(-x\u00b3) is -g(x\u00b3). So h(-x) becomes f(-g(x\u00b3)). Since f is even, that's the same as f(g(x\u00b3)) which is h(x). So yes, h(-x) = h(x). Therefore, h(x) is even.\n\nHmm, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. Let me double-check with an example maybe? Maybe pick specific f and g functions and test.\n\nSuppose f(x) = x\u00b2, which is even. Let g(x) = x\u00b3 - x, which is an odd function since g(-x) = (-x)^3 - (-x) = -x\u00b3 + x = -(x\u00b3 - x) = -g(x). So f(g(x\u00b3)) would be (g(x\u00b3))\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute g(x\u00b3): g(x\u00b3) = (x\u00b3)^3 - x\u00b3 = x^9 - x\u00b3. Then h(x) = (x^9 - x\u00b3)^2. Let's see what h(-x) is: h(-x) = ((-x)^9 - (-x)^3)^2 = (-x^9 + x^3)^2 = (x^3 - x^9)^2, which is the same as (x^9 - x^3)^2. So h(-x) = h(x). Yep, so that's even.\n\nAnother example: Let\u2019s pick f(x) = cos(x), which is even, and g(x) = sin(x), which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) is cos(sin(x\u00b3)). Now, let's check if this is even. \n\nh(-x) = cos(sin((-x)^3)) = cos(sin(-x\u00b3)) = cos(-sin(x\u00b3)) because sin is odd. But cos is even, so cos(-sin(x\u00b3)) = cos(sin(x\u00b3)) = h(x). So again, h(-x) = h(x). Therefore, even.\n\nWait, what if f is even but g is not necessarily linear? Let's try another one. Let f(x) = e^x + e^{-x}, which is also even. Because f(-x) = e^{-x} + e^{x} = f(x). Let\u2019s let g(x) = x^3, which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) = e^{g(x\u00b3)} + e^{-g(x\u00b3)} = e^{x^9} + e^{-x^9}. Now test h(-x). h(-x) = e^{(-x)^9} + e^{-(-x)^9} = e^{-x^9} + e^{x^9}, which is the same as h(x). So still even.\n\nWait, let me try with an f that's even, and g that's odd but not linear. Let\u2019s take f(x) = |x|, since it's even. Let g(x) be any odd function, say, g(x) = x^5 - x, which is odd.\n\nThen f(g(x\u00b3)) is |g(x\u00b3)| = |x^15 - x\u00b3|. Now, let's find h(-x) = |g((-x)^3)| = |g(-x\u00b3)| = | -g(x\u00b3) | = | - (x^15 - x\u00b3) | = |x^15 - x\u00b3| because absolute value of negative is positive. So again, h(-x) = h(x). Even.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Let me think if there's a case where it's not even.\n\nWait, suppose f is even, say f(x) = x^4 which is even, and g(x) = x^3 - x^5, which is still odd. Hmm, then g(x\u00b3) is (x\u00b3)^3 - (x\u00b3)^5 = x^9 - x^{15}, so h(x) = (x^9 - x^{15})^4. Then h(-x) = ((-x)^9 - (-x)^{15})^4. But since -x^9 = -x^9 and -x^{15} = -x^{15}. So (-x^9 - (-x^{15})) = -x^9 + x^{15}. Then h(-x) is (-x^9 + x^{15})^4.\n\nBut (-x^9 + x^{15}) is equal to -(x^9 - x^{15}), and raising it to the 4th power: (-1)^4*(x^9 - x^{15})^4 = (x^9 - x^{15})^4, same as h(x). So h(-x)=h(x). Thus even.\n\nAnother scenario: suppose f is even, g is odd, so f(g(x\u00b3)). So plugging in -x into x\u00b3 gives -x\u00b3, which, because g is odd, gives -g(x\u00b3). And since f is even, f(-g(x\u00b3))=f(g(x\u00b3))=h(x). So algebraically, yes, it's even. \n\nWait, is there any case where this wouldn't hold? Maybe if the functions are more complicated? Suppose f is even, g is odd, and f(g(x\u00b3)) is a constant function, which is also even or odd? Wait, let's say f is the constant function. Suppose f(x)=1, which is even. Let g(x)=x, which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3))=1, which is even. So in that case, it's even. Alternatively, f(x)=0 is even, g(x)=0, which is even\u2014wait, is zero function considered both even and odd? Wait, actually, the zero function is both even and odd since f(-x)=f(x) and f(-x)=-f(x). So in that trivial case, it's both.\n\nBut regardless, if h(x) is both even and odd, it's actually the zero function. But in the above problem, f is even, g is odd, so f(g(x\u00b3)) would have to be... Wait, except for the zero function, other cases?\n\nWait, if g(x\u00b3) is such that g(x\u00b3) is a constant function? Hmm, like if g(x) is a constant. Let me say g(x)=k, which is a constant. Then since g is a constant, which is also even because g(-x)=k=-k? No, wait, g(x)=k implies that it's even if k= -k, which implies k=0. So if g is a constant function, it's a constant zero function, because otherwise, if it's a non-zero constant, g(-x)=g(x) as it's a constant, but for oddity, g(-x)=-g(x), which would require k = -k, meaning k must be zero.\n\nSo in that case, if g was a constant non-zero, it can't be odd. So g must be zero function. Then f(g(x\u00b3))=f(0). If f is even, f(0) is a constant. So the result is a constant, which as I said, is both even and odd.\n\nBut in that case, is that different from just being even? Well, if it is a constant function, it's both. So, in terms of whether it's considered even or just even? Since only even and odd functions are usually defined up to sign, but as per problem statement, we can say it's even because it satisfies the condition without violating being odd. Wait, but if a function is both even and odd, it's the zero function. So if f(x)=0, then h(x)=0 is both, but in this case, if g(x)=0, then h(x)=f(0), which is a constant. So if f(0) is non-zero, h(x)=c, which is both even and odd only if c=0.\n\nBut in any case, regardless of that specific case, since in the earlier steps we showed that h(-x)=h(x), which is sufficient for being even. It might also be odd if h(x)=0, but in that case, only the zero function is both. Otherwise, h(x) would just be even.\n\nSo, when dealing with h(x)=f(g(x\u00b3)), since g is odd, the composition flips the sign, but f, being even, negates it back, leading h(x) to be even. Alternatively, all the steps algebraically lead to h(-x)=h(x). So I think it's safe to conclude that f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nI think my thought process is solid here. So, the answer must be even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nTo determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither, we start by noting that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function. \n\nA function \\( h(x) \\) is even if \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\) for all \\( x \\), and it is odd if \\( h(-x) = -h(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\nLet \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).

It tells me that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function. Hmm, okay, let me recall some properties of even and odd functions.\n\nAn even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\), right? So, if I plug in \\(-x\\), it's the same as plugging in \\( x \\). Classic examples are like \\( x^2 \\) or cosine functions. On the other hand, an odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). These functions are symmetric about the origin. Examples include \\( x^3 \\) or sine functions.\n\nSo, the problem is about composing functions here: \\( f(g(x^3)) \\). Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that \\( x^3 \\) is an odd function because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\). So, \\( g(x^3) \\) would be \\( g(\\text{something odd}) \\). But wait, \\( g \\) is an odd function, so does that mean \\( g(x^3) \\) is odd?\n\nLet me test it: if I plug in \\(-x\\) into \\( g(x^3) \\), it becomes \\( g((-x)^3) = g(-x^3) \\). Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, \\( g(x^3) \\) is indeed an odd function because \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).\n\nSo, now we have \\( g(x^3) \\) as an odd function. The next step is applying \\( f \\) to it. \\( f \\) is even, so \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). Let me set \\( y = g(x^3) \\). Then, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\) because \\( f \\) is even.\n\nNow, to check if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even or odd, I need to evaluate it at \\( -x \\) and see what happens. Let's compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\).\n\nFirst, \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\), so inside the function, we have \\( g(-x^3) \\). But as established earlier, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n\nSince \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). So, replacing \\( x \\) with \\( -x \\) in \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) doesn't change the value; that is, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). \n\nBy the definition of even functions, if \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), then \\( h(x) \\) is even. So here, \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\), and plugging in \\( -x \\) doesn't change the value. That suggests that \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is indeed an even function.\n\nWait, let me make sure there are no mistakes here. What if the composition is more complex? Hmm, let's try a concrete example.\n\nSuppose \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\), which is odd. Then, \\( f(g(x^3)) = (x^3)^2 = x^6 \\). Now, is \\( x^6 \\) even? Yes, because \\( (-x)^6 = x^6 \\). That works.\n\nLet me try another example. Let \\( f(x) = \\cos(x) \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = \\sin(x) \\), which is odd. Then, \\( g(x^3) = \\sin(x^3) \\). Applying \\( f \\), we get \\( \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\). Hmmm, is this function even or odd?\n\nLet's test \\( \\cos(\\sin((-x)^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(-x^3)) \\). Since sine is odd, \\( \\sin(-x^3) = -\\sin(x^3) \\), so \\( \\cos(-\\sin(x^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\) because cosine is even. So, indeed, the composition remains the same when replacing \\( x \\) with \\( -x \\), which means it's even. That seems to back up my earlier conclusion.\n\nIs there a case where it might not be even? Suppose \\( f \\) is a constant function, which is trivially even. Then \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is just a constant, which is even. If \\( f \\) is something else, like \\( f(x) = |x| \\), which is also even, then composing with any odd function inside would still give an even function because \\( |g(x^3)| \\) is the same as \\( |g(-x^3)| \\) since both \\( x^3 \\) and \\( -x^3 \\) are mapped to their absolute values by \\( f \\).\n\nSo, it seems consistent. Each example I test is confirming that the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even when \\( f \\) is even and \\( g \\) is odd. I don't see a scenario where it could be odd. Since both functions have specific symmetries, the result inherits the symmetry from \\( f \\).\n\nWait, but why does it not become odd? Suppose \\( f \\) was odd instead, but in our case, it's even. So, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is made by an even function composed with an odd function inside another odd function. That seems like it would preserve some symmetry but not necessarily switch it.\n\nWait, perhaps another angle: if \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\), and then \\( f(g(-x)) = f(-g(x)) \\). But since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x)) = f(g(x)) \\). So, \\( f(g(-x)) = f(g(x)) \\), which means \\( f(g(x)) \\) is even.\n\nTherefore, in our case, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even because \\( f(g(-x^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nYes, that seems to solidify the conclusion. So, applying \\( f \\) after an odd function preserves the evenness because of how even functions treat negatives inside.\n\nSo, to recap, since \\( g(x^3) \\) is odd, when you apply an even function \\( f \\) to it, the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) becomes even. Therefore, the answer should be that \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is an even function.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1. An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n2. An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n3. The function \\( x^3 \\) is an odd function because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\).\n\nFirst, we evaluate \\( g(x^3) \\):\n- Since \\( g \\) is an odd function, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, \\( g(x^3) \\) is an odd function.\n\nNext, we apply the even function \\( f \\) to \\( g(x^3) \\):\n- Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). Let \\( y = g(x^3) \\). Then, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nTo check if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, we evaluate it at \\( -x \\):\n- \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n- Since \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\), we have \\( f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n- Because \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nThus, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even because it satisfies the condition \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nThe function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>",
        "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c><\uff5cUser\uff5c>Please solve the following mathematical problem, placing your final answer within \\boxed{}:\nIf $f(x)$ is an even function and $g(x)$ is an odd function, find if $f(g(x^3))$ is even, odd, or neither.\n\nEnter \"odd\", \"even\", or \"neither\".<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, we have two functions here: f(x) is even, and g(x) is odd. The question is asking about the nature of another function, f(g(x\u00b3)). Is it even, odd, or neither?\n\nOkay, let me recall my function properties. Even functions satisfy the condition f(-x) = f(x), right? So, for example, f(x) = x\u00b2 is even because (-x)\u00b2 = x\u00b2. On the other hand, odd functions satisfy g(-x) = -g(x), like g(x) = x\u00b3 because (-x)\u00b3 = -x\u00b3.\n\nSo, we're dealing with f(g(x\u00b3)). Let me break this down step by step. First, I can think of the operations as a composition of functions. So, starting from the innermost function, we have x\u00b3, then we apply g to that, and finally f to the result.\n\nGiven that, let's try to test whether f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, odd, or neither. The standard method is to compute f(g((-x)\u00b3)) and see how it relates to f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n1. Compute (-x)\u00b3: that's -x\u00b3. Okay, that negative sign is important.\n2. Then apply g to that result: g(-x\u00b3). But since g is an odd function, g(-a) = -g(a) for any a. So, g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3).\n3. Now, we plug that into f: f(-g(x\u00b3)). So, we have f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n\nBut wait, f is an even function. Even functions satisfy f(-y) = f(y) for any y. So, if we let y = g(x\u00b3), then f(-y) = f(y). Therefore, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nPutting it all together: f(g((-x)\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)). \n\nThis means that when we substitute -x into the function f(g(x\u00b3)), we just get the same value as f(g(x\u00b3)). Which by definition of even functions is exactly what even means.\n\nSo, it seems that f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nBut hold on, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It often helps to test with specific examples for f and g that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nLet's choose f(x) as an even function. The simplest example is f(x) = x\u00b2.\n\nLet's pick g(x) as an odd function. Again, the simplest example is g(x) = x\u00b3.\n\nNow, let's compute f(g(x\u00b3)). Let's see:\n\n- First, compute x\u00b3. Then, apply g to that: g(x\u00b3) = (x\u00b3)\u00b3 = x\u2079.\n- Then, apply f to x\u2079: f(x\u2079) = (x\u2079)\u00b2 = x\u00b9\u2078.\n\nSo, f(g(x\u00b3)) = x\u00b9\u2078.\n\nNow, is x\u00b9\u2078 an even function? Well, yes, because if we replace x with -x, we have (-x)\u00b9\u2078 = x\u00b9\u2078, which is the same as the original function.\n\nSo, in this specific example, f(g(x\u00b3)) is indeed an even function.\n\nLet me try another example to make sure my reasoning isn't flawed.\n\nLet me choose a different even function, say f(x) = cos(x), which is even since cos(-x) = cos(x).\n\nAnd another odd function, say g(x) = x.\n\nSo, f(g(x\u00b3)) becomes f(x\u00b3) = cos(x\u00b3).\n\nIs cos(x\u00b3) even? Yes, because cos(-x\u00b3)=cos(x\u00b3). So, it maintains the evenness.\n\nAnother example: f(x) = |x|, which is even, and g(x) = sin(x), which is odd.\n\nThen, f(g(x\u00b3)) = |g(x\u00b3)| = |sin(x\u00b3)|. Is this even? Let's see: |sin(-x\u00b3)| = | - sin(x\u00b3) | = |sin(x\u00b3)|, so yes, it is even.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Maybe I should try a non-monotonic example.\n\nLet\u2019s take f(x) = x\u00b2 + 1, which is still even, and g(x) = x\u00b3 - x, which is odd because g(-x) = (-x)\u00b3 - (-x) = -x\u00b3 + x = - (x\u00b3 - x) = -g(x).\n\nThen, f(g(x\u00b3)) would be [g(x\u00b3)]\u00b2 + 1 = [ (x\u00b3)\u00b3 - (x\u00b3) ]\u00b2 + 1 = (x\u2079 - x\u00b3)\u00b2 + 1.\n\nExpanding this, we get (x\u00b9\u2078 - 2x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u2076) + 1. Is this even? Yes, since all the exponents are even numbers. So replacing x with -x would yield the same result: [ (-x)\u2079 - (-x)\u00b3 ]\u00b2 + 1 = (-x\u2079 + x\u00b3)\u00b2 + 1 = (x\u2079 - x\u00b3)\u00b2 + 1, which is the same as the original.\n\nSo, again, it's even. Hmm, interesting. Maybe this is a consistent result.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me try a function where perhaps f(g(x\u00b3)) could have different behavior.\n\nSuppose f(x) is even, but not as straightforward, like f(x) = e^(-x\u00b2), which is even since it's symmetric around the y-axis. And then g(x) is odd, say g(x) = x. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) = e^(-x\u2076). Which is still even because exponentials of even powers remain even.\n\nHold on, let me see if I can manage a contrived example where f(g(x\u00b3)) isn't even. Maybe f(x) is even, but somehow g doesn't preserve the signature. But given that g is odd, g(-x) = -g(x), which would inherently create symmetry that when squared or composed within f, which is even, might nullify any asymmetry.\n\nThinking in terms of composition, if you have an even function applied on an odd function, then inside you have an odd function, then applied to an even function, overall what is the result? Wait, perhaps we can think about it as f(g(x)).\n\nBut in our case, it's f(g(x\u00b3)). So, perhaps let\u2019s dissect that:\n\nFirst, x\u00b3 is an odd function, because if you flip x to -x, it becomes -x\u00b3. Then, applying g, which is itself an odd function, so g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). Then, applying f, which is even, so f(-g(x\u00b3))=f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nSo, in other words, f(g(-x\u00b3))=f(g(x\u00b3)) which is exactly the condition for f(g(x\u00b3)) being even.\n\nTherefore, it does hold.\n\nThus, yes, f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nI think that seems consistent across multiple examples. So, I can conclude that f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1. **Understanding the properties**:\n   - An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\).\n   - An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\n2. **Testing the composition**:\n   - Compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\).\n   - Simplify \\( (-x)^3 \\) to \\( -x^3 \\).\n   - Apply \\( g \\) to \\( -x^3 \\).

Let me recall some definitions first. An even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain, and an odd function satisfies f(-x) = -f(x) for all x. \n\nGiven that f(x) is even, so f(-y) = f(y) for any y. And g(x) is odd, so g(-y) = -g(y). Now, I need to determine the nature of the composite function f(g(x^3)). \n\nFirst, maybe I should express f(g(x^3)) in terms of x and then evaluate it at -x to see how it behaves. Let me denote h(x) = f(g(x^3)), so h(-x) will be f(g((-x)^3)). Hmm, since (-x)^3 is equal to -x^3, this simplifies to h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)). \n\nBut wait, g is an odd function, so g(-y) = -g(y). Let me substitute y with x^3 in this equation, so g(-x^3) = -g(x^3). Therefore, h(-x) becomes f(-g(x^3)). \n\nNow, f is an even function, so f(-z) = f(z) for any z. Let me let z = g(x^3), so f(-g(x^3)) becomes f(g(x^3)). Therefore, h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) which is exactly h(x). \n\nSo that means h(-x) = h(x), which is the definition of an even function. So, f(g(x^3)) is an even function. Let me just go through that step by step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n1. Start with h(x) = f(g(x^3)).\n2. Compute h(-x): f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(-x^3)).\n3. Since g is odd, g(-x^3) = -g(x^3).\n4. So, h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)).\n5. Since f is even, f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)).\n6. And that is h(x).\n7. Hence, h(-x) = h(x), so h(x) is even.\n\nYeah, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in that reasoning. So, f(g(x^3)) should be even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine whether the function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1. Start with the function \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n2. Evaluate \\( h(-x) \\): \n   \\[\n   h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3))\n   \\]\n3. Simplify the argument inside \\( g \\):\n   \\[\n   (-x)^3 = -x^3\n   \\]\n   Thus,\n   \\[\n   h(-x) = f(g(-x^3))\n   \\]\n4. Since \\( g(x) \\) is odd, we have \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore,\n   \\[\n   h(-x) = f(-g(x^3))\n   \\]\n5. Since \\( f(x) \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). Hence,\n   \\[\n   h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x)\n   \\]\n6. This shows that \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), which means \\( h(x) \\) is an even function.\n\nThus, the function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>",

They told me that f(x) is even and g(x) is odd. Hmm, okay, let me recall what even and odd functions are.\n\nAn even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain. So, if I plug in -x, I get the same result as when I plug in x. Classic examples are functions like x\u00b2 or cos(x).\n\nAn odd function, on the other hand, satisfies g(-x) = -g(x). So, flipping the sign of x flips the sign of the output. Examples are x\u00b3, sin(x), etc.\n\nAlright, so we have to figure out the nature of f(g(x\u00b3)). Let\u2019s break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe I should figure out what happens when I plug in -x into f(g(x\u00b3)). If f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, then f(g(-x\u00b3)) should equal f(g(x\u00b3)). If it's odd, then f(g(-x\u00b3)) should equal -f(g(x\u00b3)). Otherwise, it would be neither.\n\nSo, let's compute f(g(-x\u00b3)).\n\nSince g is an odd function, g(-x\u00b3) should be equal to -g(x\u00b3). Okay, so:\n\nf(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-g(x\u00b3))\n\nNow, f is an even function, so f(-y) = f(y) for any y. Therefore, replacing y with g(x\u00b3):\n\nf(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3))\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nf(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3))\n\nWhich means f(g(x\u00b3)) satisfies f(-x) = f(x), right? Because replacing x with -x gives the same value.\n\nWait a second, does that make f(g(x\u00b3)) an even function?\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn\u2019t skip a step.\n\nWe had f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-g(x\u00b3)). Since f is even, -g(x\u00b3) inside f is the same as g(x\u00b3), so f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nTherefore, f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)), meaning f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nWait, is there another perspective? Maybe thinking about the composition of functions and their symmetries.\n\nLet me consider the composition f(g(x\u00b3)). The inside function is x\u00b3, which is odd because (-x)\u00b3 = -x\u00b3. So, the inside function is odd.\n\nThen, the outside function is f, which is even. So, f of an odd function? But how does that affect the composition?\n\nIf I recall, composing an even function around an odd function, what does that do? Hmm. Let me think about transformations.\n\nIf you have an even function, say f, and you plug another function h(x) into it. Then, f(h(-x)) = f(-h(x)) because h is odd. But since f is even, f(-h(x)) = f(h(x)). So, f(h(-x)) = f(h(x)).\n\nWhich means f(h(x)) is even.\n\nIn our problem, h(x) is x\u00b3, which is odd. Therefore, f(g(x\u00b3)) as a composition of an even function f around an odd function g(x\u00b3) is even.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, is x\u00b3 an odd function? Yes, because (-x)^3 = -x\u00b3.\n\nThen, g being odd, so plugging that in, I have g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). Then, plugging that into f, which is even, so f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nThat gives us f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)), so f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nLet me try testing it with specific functions to see if this makes sense.\n\nSuppose g(x) = x, which is definitely odd, and f(x) = x\u00b2, which is even. So, f(g(x\u00b3)) = (x\u00b3)\u00b2 = x^6. Is x^6 even? Yes, because (-x)^6 = x^6.\n\nAnother example: Let g(x) = x\u00b3 (which is odd), and f(x) = x^4 (even). Then, f(g(x)) = (x\u00b3)^4 = x^{12}, which is even.\n\nWait, maybe an example where g(x) is some other odd function, like g(x) = sin(x). Let f(x) = x\u00b2 (even). Then, f(g(x^3)) = (sin(x\u00b3))^2. Is that even?\n\nYes, because (sin((-x)^3))^2 = (sin(-x\u00b3))^2 = (-sin(x\u00b3))^2 = (sin(x\u00b3))^2. So, it's even.\n\nAnother test case: let g(x) = -x, which is odd, because g(-x) = -(-x) = x = -g(x). Wait, really? No, actually, g(-x) = -(-x) = x = -g(x) if g(x) = -x. Wait, plugging in x, g(x) = -x, so g(-x) = -(-x) = x, which is -g(x). So, it is odd. So, putting into f(x) = x^3, which is odd, but f needs to be even. So, f(g(x^3)) = (g(x^3))^3 = ( -x^9 )^3 = -x^{27}, which is odd. Wait, hold on, but f is supposed to be even. Wait, let me redo that.\n\nHold on, if f is even, so f(x) = |x| for example. Then, f(g(x\u00b3)) = |g(x\u00b3)|. Since g is odd, g(x\u00b3) is odd, so |g(x\u00b3)| is even, right? Because absolute value makes all negatives positive.\n\nWait, actually, if g(x) is odd, then g(x^3) is odd because x\u00b3 is odd so composing it with g (odd) gives odd, as substitution. So |g(x\u00b3)| is even because the absolute value wraps it, so flipping the sign doesn't matter. Therefore, even.\n\nBut maybe if f is x^2, which is even, f(g(x\u00b3)) = [g(x\u00b3)]\u00b2, which is [(-x\u00b3)]\u00b2 = x^6, which is even.\n\nWait, but if f is an even function and g is odd, f(g(x\u00b3)) is going to be f of something that is odd, but f is even, so f(-y) = f(y). Therefore, f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nWait, yeah, as in the first step. So, f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nThese test cases are showing it's even, so my conclusion seems right.\n\nWait, let me see one more test case where f and g might be more complicated. Suppose f(x) = |x| + x\u00b2, which is even, and g(x) = x, which is odd. Then, f(g(x\u00b3)) = |x\u00b3| + (x\u00b3)\u00b2 = |x\u00b3| + x^6, which is even because absolute value is even and x^6 is even. So, sum is even.\n\nAnother example: f(x) = e^{x} + e^{-x}, which is even, since substituting -x gives e^{-x} + e^{x} which is the same. If g(x) is any odd function, say, g(x) = x. Then, f(g(x\u00b3)) = e^{x\u00b3} + e^{-x\u00b3}, which is even.\n\nWait, is that even? Because if I put -x, I get e^{-x\u00b3} + e^{x\u00b3}, which is the same as before. So yes, even yes.\n\nWait, another odd function for g: g(x) = x^3, so that's an odd function, plug into an even f(x). If f(x) = x^4, then f(g(x\u00b3)) is (x^3)^4 = x^{12}, which is even. If f(x) is |x|, then f(g(x\u00b3)) = |x^3| = |x| x^2, which is even.\n\nSo, all my test cases are giving me that f(g(x\u00b3)) is even. Therefore, I think it's safe to conclude it's even.\n\nWait, what would happen if g were even? Then, g(-x) = g(x), so f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)), and if f is even as well, then f(g(x\u00b3)) would still be even. But in this case, g is odd, so that composition flips to f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)), so the same function.\n\nSo, yeah, seems that as long as f is even and g is odd, then f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to think in terms of composition properties. So, f(g(x\u00b3)) is a composition where the innermost function is x\u00b3 which is odd, composing with g, which is odd, so the result is still odd if you consider g(x\u00b3). Then, f is even, so function f applied to an odd function.\n\nBut when you apply an even function on an odd function, do you get even or odd? So, if h(x) is odd, then f(h(x)) where f is even. Then, f(h(-x)) = f(-h(x)) = f(h(x)). So, f(h(-x)) = f(h(x)), which means f(h(x)) is even.\n\nHence f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nSo, that seems to fit.\n\nAlternatively, because x\u00b3 is odd, the composition inside is g(x\u00b3), which is odd, then f is even, so the outer function is even, so when you apply it to an odd function, you get an even function.\n\nHence, all of these lines of thought lead me to the conclusion that it's even. Therefore, the answer should be even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nTo determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither, we start by recalling the properties of even and odd functions.

I need to determine whether the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\nFirst, let me recall some definitions. An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in its domain. On the other hand, an odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). Now, I need to analyze the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nLet me break it down step by step. The composition involves three functions: first, \\( x^3 \\), then \\( g \\), and finally \\( f \\). So, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is a composition of these three functions.\n\nSince \\( x^3 \\) is a function, let's think about whether it's even or odd. Remember, \\( (x)^3 \\) is an odd function because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\). So, the innermost function \\( x^3 \\) is odd.\n\nNext, \\( g(x) \\) is given as an odd function, so if I apply \\( g \\) to \\( x^3 \\), which is odd, how does that affect the result? Let me compute \\( g(x^3) \\). If \\( g \\) is odd, then \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). But since we're dealing with \\( g \\) applied to \\( x^3 \\), maybe it's helpful to consider substituting \\( -x \\) into \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) and see what happens.\n\nSo, let's define \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\). To check if \\( h(x) \\) is even or odd, I'll compute \\( h(-x) \\) and compare it to \\( h(x) \\) and \\( -h(x) \\).\n\nComputing \\( h(-x) \\):\n\n\\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\)  \nSimplify \\( (-x)^3 \\).  \n\\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\), so  \n\\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n\nNow, since \\( g \\) is an odd function, \\( g(-y) = -g(y) \\) for any y. Let me set \\( y = x^3 \\), so:\n\n\\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).  \nTherefore,  \n\\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).  \nBut \\( f \\) is an even function. Applying an even function to \\( -g(x^3) \\) gives:  \n\\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), because \\( f(-a) = f(a) \\) when \\( f \\) is even.\n\nSo, \\( h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( h(x) \\) satisfies the condition for being an even function: \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\). Hence, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\nWait, let me go through that again to make sure I haven't missed anything. Starting with \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\). \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\) because \\( g \\) is odd. Then, passing this through \\( f \\), which is even, so \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). That brings us back to \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so yes, it's definitely even.\n\nIs there a possibility that this could be neither? Hmm, not unless maybe the composition somehow disrupts the evenness or oddness in a non-uniform way, but in this case, each step follows from the properties of even and odd functions.\n\nWait, let me think about function composition in general. So, if I have f(g(x)), where f is even and g is odd, does it always result in an even function?\n\nLet me test with concrete functions. Let me choose f(x) = x\u00b2 (which is even) and g(x) = x\u00b3 (which is odd). Then, f(g(x)) = (x\u00b3)\u00b2 = x\u2076, which is even, because substituting -x gives (-x)^6 = x^6, same as f(g(x)). So that's consistent.\n\nAnother example: Let f(x) = cos(x) which is even, and g(x) = sin(x) which is odd. Then f(g(x)) = cos(sin(x)). Now, is this even? Let's test for x:\n\nf(g(-x)) = cos(sin(-x)) = cos(-sin(x)) = cos(sin(x)) because cosine is even. Therefore, f(g(-x)) = f(g(x)), so it is even. Therefore, this composition is also even.\n\nConversely, if I have f(x) even and g(x) odd, another thought: What if f is a reflection or something else? Wait, f and g are arbitrary functions with those parity properties. So as long as f is even, applying f to an odd function in this way gives an even result.\n\nWait a sec, but in the composition, do we ensure anything about the function's expression? For instance, is it always that way regardless of what f and g are, as long as f is even and g is odd?\n\nLet me see. Suppose f is another even function, say f(x) = x^4, and g(x) = x^3. Then, f(g(x)) = (x^3)^4 = x^{12}, which is even. So it still holds. What if I choose f(x) = |x|, which is even, and g(x) = x^3, which is odd? Then f(g(x)) is |x^3|, which is even as | -x^3 | = |x^3|. So yes.\n\nWhat if g(x) is a more complicated odd function? For example, \\( g(x) = x - x^3 \\). Wait, is that odd? Let's check: g(-x) = (-x) - (-x)^3 = -x - (-x^3) = -x + x^3. Which is not equal to -g(x), because -g(x) = -x + x^3. So in that case, g(x) would satisfy g(-x) = -g(x), meaning it is still odd.\n\nThen, \\( f(g(x)) = (x - x^3)^2 \\), which is even, because squared removes any negative signs.\n\nAlternatively, let me try another approach without plugging in specific functions. Let's compose f and g symbolically.\n\nSince \\( f(x) \\) is even, we know \\( f(-a) = f(a) \\) for any \\( a \\). Let \\( a = g(x^3) \\), then \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). Now, \\( g \\) is odd, so \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). So if I consider \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\), but as \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\). So \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so \\( h(x) \\) is even.\n\nThus, in every case, regardless of what f and g are (as long as f is even and g is odd), the composition \\( f \\circ g \\circ (-x^3) \\) will result in an even function.\n\nWait a moment, what if I made a mistake in how the functions compose? Hmm, the composition is \\( f(g(x^3)) \\), so x is cubed first, then g is applied, then f is applied. So \\( x^3 \\) is in the inner argument of g, which is odd, and then f is an even function on that result.\n\nHmm, another thing, let's suppose \\( f \\) is a non-trivial even function and \\( g \\) is a non-trivial odd function. Is their composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) necessarily even? Since the composition only involves substituting \\( -x \\) into \\( g(x^3) \\), which, since \\( g \\) is odd, negates the whole expression, but then \\( f \\) is even, so it doesn't negate anything.\n\nSo seems like no matter what, substituting \\( -x \\) in the outermost function doesn't change the result because \\( f \\) is even, negating the entire inner function, but after \\( g \\) is already odd.\n\nTherefore, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\nBut wait, just to test an example where perhaps the composition would not be even? Is that possible?\n\nWait, if we mess with the order, for example, suppose \\( f(g x) \\) then cube it, but in our case, it's \\( f(g(x^3)) \\), so the structure is fixed. Maybe if the functions were inside differently, but here it's as above.\n\nAlternatively, taking \\( x \\rightarrow -x \\):\n\nf(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(-x^3)) because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\).  \nThen, since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).  \nThus, \\( f(-g(x^3)) \\).  \nBut \\( f \\) is even, so \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nSo again, we get \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so h is even.\n\nTherefore, in the given composition order, f(g(x^3)), where f is even, g is odd, \\( x^3 \\) is odd.\n\nTherefore, it's even.\n\nWait, so it can't be neither because it is equal to h(-x) = h(x). So that suggests it is even.\n\nBut maybe we can think if there is a case when it could be neither.\n\nIs there an instance where substituting the negative variable leads to something different that's not h(x) but not equal to h(-x)?\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nDefine a specific even f and odd g and see.\n\nLet f(x) = x^4 (even), g(x) = x^5 (odd), so f(g(x^3)) = (x^3)^5)^4?

So if \\( g(x) = x^5 \\), then \\( g(x^3) = (x^3)^5 = x^{15} \\), so \\( f(g(x^3)) = (x^{15})^4 = x^{60} \\). Then, since that's even because x^{60} is even, same as x^{60} is (-x)^{60} = x^{60}.\n\nWait, so that's an example of an even function.\n\nAnother example, let\u2019s take f(x) = cos(x), which is even, and g(x) = sin(x), which is odd. Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\). Wait, sin is odd, so sin(x^3) is odd because it's composed with x^3 which is odd (and sin is odd: sin(-y) = -sin(y)). So sin(x^3) is odd.\n\nThen, cos is even, so cos(-y) = cos(y). So cos(sin(x^3)) = cos(-sin(x)) = cos(sin(x)). So this is equality, hence, h(-x) = h(x), so it is even.\n\nWait, but actually \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is a function whose evenness we've established, so in all cases, function h(x) satisfies h(-x) = h(x). So, h is even.\n\nTherefore, despite the compositions, h is even.\n\nSo, in all steps, the result becomes even.\n\nConclusion: \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine whether the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\nFirst, recall the definitions:\n- An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\).\n- An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\nWe need to analyze the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\).

I need to figure out whether f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, odd, or neither. Hmm, let's start by recalling what it means for a function to be even or odd.\n\nAn even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain. On the other hand, an odd function satisfies g(-x) = -g(x) for all x in its domain. So, f(x) is even, meaning if I plug in -x, it's the same as plugging in x. And g(x) is odd, meaning plugging in -x flips the sign of the function.\n\nI need to analyze the function h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)). Let's see, I should check if h(-x) equals h(x) or -h(x) or neither. That will tell me if h(x) is even, odd, or neither.\n\nStarting with h(-x), which is f(g((-x)\u00b3)). Let me compute the inside first: (-x)\u00b3. Since any odd power preserves the sign, (-x)\u00b3 = -x\u00b3. So, h(-x) becomes f(g(-x\u00b3)).\n\nNow, since g is an odd function, g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). So, substituting that back, h(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)). \n\nNow, looking at f(-g(x\u00b3)). Since f is even, f(-t) = f(t) for any t. Let's set t = g(x\u00b3). So, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)). Therefore, h(-x) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nBut wait, f(g(x\u00b3)) is exactly h(x). So, h(-x) = h(x). That means h(x) is even. \n\nLet me recap to make sure. Starting with h(-x), substitute in, use the properties of f and g. Since g is odd, (-x)^3 is -x\u00b3, and then since f is even, f of negative something is just f of that something. So, h(-x) equals h(x), hence h is even. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in that reasoning. The key steps were recognizing that x\u00b3 is odd, so (-x)\u00b3 is -x\u00b3, then using the oddness of g to bring out the negative, and then the evenness of f to remove the negative. It all works out that h(-x) equals h(x).\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider specific examples to see if it makes sense. Suppose g(x) is something simple, like g(x) = x, which is odd. Then g(x\u00b3) = x\u00b3. So then f(g(x\u00b3)) = f(x\u00b3). Now, f is even, so f(-x\u00b3) = f(x\u00b3). Therefore, f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-x\u00b3) = f(x\u00b3) = f(g(x\u00b3)), which shows that h(-x) = h(x), confirming that h is even.\n\nAlternatively, take g(x) = x\u00b3, which is also odd. Then, g(x\u00b3) = x\u2079, which is also odd. Then, h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = f(x\u2079). Since f is even, plugging in x\u2079 or -x\u2079 doesn't change the value; f(x\u2079) = f(-x\u2079). Therefore, h(-x\u00b3) = f(-x\u2079) = f(x\u2079) = h(x\u00b3), so again h is even. \n\nWait, actually, no\u2014hold on, in this case, since h(-x) is f(g((-x)^3)) = f((-x)^3 * something). Wait, maybe examples can be tricky because the function might behave differently. Let me think of another example.\n\nSay f(x) is x\u00b2, which is even. Let g(x) be x\u00b3, which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) would be (x\u00b3)\u00b2 = x\u2076, which is even. Because f(g(-x\u00b3)) = (-x\u00b3)\u00b2 = x\u2076, which is same as f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nAnother example, f(x) = |x|, which is even. Take g(x) = x - x\u00b3, which is odd since -g(x) = -(x - x\u00b3) = -x + x\u00b3 = - (x - x\u00b3) = g(-x). So f(g(x\u00b3)) = |x\u00b3 - (x\u00b3)\u00b3| = |x\u00b3 - x\u2079|. Now, f(g(-x\u00b3)) = |(-x\u00b3) - (-x\u00b3)^3| = | -x\u00b3 - (-x\u2079)| = | -x\u00b3 + x\u2079 | = |x\u2079 -x\u00b3|. Since absolute value doesn't care about the sign, this is the same as |x\u00b3 - x\u2079| which is equal to f(g(x\u00b3)). So, h(-x\u00b3) = h(x\u00b3), meaning h is even.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So the conclusion is that in these cases, it seems to hold. So, probably the answer is even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\nAn even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) and an odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\nLet \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nTo determine if \\( h(x) \\) is even or odd, we evaluate \\( h(-x) \\):\n- \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\)\n- Since \\((-x)^3 = -x^3\\), we have \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\)\n- Because \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\), so \\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\)\n- Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\)\n\nThus, \\( h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\), which means \\( h(x) \\) is even.\n\nTherefore, the function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\(\\boxed{even}\\).<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>"

Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you multiply two polynomials, the degree of the resulting polynomial is the sum of the degrees of the two polynomials being multiplied. Here, the left side is (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) multiplied by p(x), and the right side is a fourth-degree polynomial, which is x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25. So, if I let the degree of p(x) be n, then 2 + n = 4 because the left side will have degree 2 + n. Therefore, n must be 2, which means p(x) is a quadratic polynomial. So, p(x) must be of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are constants that I need to find.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation: (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5)(ax\u00b2 + bx + c) = x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25. My job is to expand the left side and then compare the coefficients with the right side to find a, b, and c.\n\nLet me expand the left side step by step. I'll distribute each term in (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) across each term in (ax\u00b2 + bx + c):\n\nFirst, multiply x\u00b2 by each term in (ax\u00b2 + bx + c):\n- x\u00b2 * ax\u00b2 = a x\u2074\n- x\u00b2 * bx = b x\u00b3\n- x\u00b2 * c = c x\u00b2\n\nNext, multiply -3x by each term in (ax\u00b2 + bx + c):\n- -3x * ax\u00b2 = -3a x\u00b3\n- -3x * bx = -3b x\u00b2\n- -3x * c = -3c x\n\nThen, multiply 5 by each term in (ax\u00b2 + bx + c):\n- 5 * ax\u00b2 = 5a x\u00b2\n- 5 * bx = 5b x\n- 5 * c = 5c\n\nSo, combining all these terms, the left side becomes:\na x\u2074 + b x\u00b3 + c x\u00b2 - 3a x\u00b3 - 3b x\u00b2 - 3c x + 5a x\u00b2 + 5b x + 5c\n\nNow, I need to combine the like terms:\n\nFor x\u2074: a x\u2074\n\nFor x\u00b3: b x\u00b3 - 3a x\u00b3 = (b - 3a) x\u00b3\n\nFor x\u00b2: c x\u00b2 - 3b x\u00b2 + 5a x\u00b2 = (c - 3b + 5a) x\u00b2\n\nFor x: -3c x + 5b x = ( -3c + 5b ) x\n\nConstant term: 5c\n\nSo, putting it all together, the expanded form is:\na x\u2074 + (b - 3a) x\u00b3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x\u00b2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c\n\nNow, this should be equal to the right side, x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25.\n\nTherefore, we can set up equations by comparing coefficients for each power of x.\n\nLet me write down these equations:\n\n1. Coefficient of x\u2074: a = 1\n2. Coefficient of x\u00b3: b - 3a = -3\n3. Coefficient of x\u00b2: c - 3b + 5a = 0 (since there's no x\u00b2 term on the right side)\n4. Coefficient of x: (-3c + 5b) = 15\n5. Constant term: 5c = -25\n\nOkay, now I can solve these equations step by step.\n\nStarting with equation 1: a = 1. That gives me a = 1.\n\nPlug a = 1 into equation 2: b - 3(1) = -3 => b - 3 = -3. Adding 3 to both sides gives b = 0.\n\nNow, with a = 1 and b = 0, let's move to equation 3: c - 3(0) + 5(1) = 0 => c + 5 = 0 => c = -5.\n\nNow, check equation 4 with b = 0 and c = -5: (-3*(-5) + 5*0) = 15 + 0 = 15, which matches the right side (15). So, equation 4 is satisfied.\n\nFinally, equation 5: 5c = -25. With c = -5, let's check this: 5*(-5) = -25, which is correct.\n\nSo, all equations have been satisfied with a = 1, b = 0, c = -5. Therefore, the polynomial p(x) is ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 1x\u00b2 + 0x - 5, which simplifies to x\u00b2 - 5.\n\nLet me quickly double-check my solution by multiplying (x\u00b2 - 3x +5) by (x\u00b2 -5) to make sure I get x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25.\n\nMultiplying:\n\nFirst, x\u00b2 times x\u00b2 = x\u2074\n\nx\u00b2 times (-5) = -5x\u00b2\n\n-3x times x\u00b2 = -3x\u00b3\n\n-3x times (-5) = 15x\n\n5 times x\u00b2 = 5x\u00b2\n\n5 times (-5) = -25\n\nSo, combining:\n\nx\u2074\n\n-3x\u00b3\n\n-5x\u00b2 + 5x\u00b2 = 0x\u00b2\n\n15x\n\n-25\n\nSo, putting altogether: x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25, which is x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Perfect, that's exactly the right side. So, p(x) = x\u00b2 -5.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. Let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Also, just to be sure, is there any other way this could be approached?\n\nAnother possible method is polynomial division: divide x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x -25 by x\u00b2 -3x +5 and see if I get p(x).\n\nLet me try that.\n\nDivide x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25 by x\u00b2 -3x +5.\n\nSetting it up:\n\nDividend: x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +0x\u00b2 +15x -25\n\nDivisor: x\u00b2 -3x +5\n\nWe divide term by term.\n\nFirst term: x\u2074 divided by x\u00b2 is x\u00b2.\n\nMultiply divisor by x\u00b2: x\u00b2*(x\u00b2 -3x +5)=x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2\n\nSubtract this from the dividend:\n\n(x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +0x\u00b2 +15x -25) - (x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2) = 0x\u2074 +0x\u00b3 -5x\u00b2 +15x -25\n\nSo, now we have: -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nNext, divide this by the divisor x\u00b2 -3x +5. The leading term is -5x\u00b2 divided by x\u00b2 is -5.\n\nMultiply divisor by -5: -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nSubtract this from the current dividend:\n\n(-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) - (-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) = 0\n\nSo, no remainder. Thus, the quotient is x\u00b2 -5, which is exactly what I found earlier.\n\nOkay, that's another way to verify it, and the result is the same. So, p(x) is definitely x\u00b2 -5.\n\nWait, just one more check. Let me try synthetic division or another method.\n\nBut dividing a quartic by a quadratic, long division is probably straightforward, which I just did, and it worked.\n\nAlternatively, I can also try plugging in some values.\n\nLet me suppose p(x) = x\u00b2 -5, then when x=1, (1 -3 +5)p(1) = (3)(1 -5)=3*(-4)=-12; On the right side, x=1: 1 -3 +15 -25= (1-3)=-2, (15-25)=-10, so total is (-12). So, yes, it matches.\n\nAnother test, x=0: Left side: p(0)*(0 - 0 +5)=?\n\nWait, No, for x=0, plugging in, left side is (0 -0 +5)*p(0)=5*p(0). Right side is 0 -0 +0 -25 = -25. So, 5*p(0) = -25, which implies p(0)= -5. Looking at p(x)=x\u00b2 -5, p(0)=0 -5= -5, which is correct. That's consistent.\n\nTest another value: x=2. Left side: (4 -6 +5)*p(2)= (3)* (4 -5)=3*(-1)=-3.\n\nRight side: 16 -24 +30 -25= (16-24)= -8, (30-25)=5. So, (-8+5)= -3. Which matches. So, yeah, p(2) is 4-5=-1, and 3*(-1)= -3. That's good.\n\nHmm. Alright, I think I've verified it enough.\n\nThe polynomial p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\(\\boxed{x^2 - 5}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25\\), we start by noting that the degree of \\( p(x) \\) must be 2 since the product on the left side is a fourth-degree polynomial.

In this case, one of them is a quadratic (\\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\)) and when multiplied by \\( p(x) \\), it results in a quartic polynomial (\\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\)). So, that means \\( p(x) \\) must be a quadratic polynomial itself, right? Because when a quadratic multiplies another quadratic, you get a quartic. Let me confirm that: yes, (degree 2) * (degree n) = degree (2 + n). Here, the result is degree 4, so \\( p(x) \\) must be degree 2. So, \\( p(x) \\) is a quadratic.\n\nSo, let me represent \\( p(x) \\) as \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants that I need to find. My goal is to find these constants such that when I multiply \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) by \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), I get the given quartic polynomial.\n\nAlright, let's set up the multiplication. I'll write the product:\n\n\\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c) \\)\n\nI need to expand this and then set it equal to \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). Then, by equating the coefficients of like terms, I can solve for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nFirst, let's carry out the multiplication step by step. Let's expand term by term.\n\nMultiply \\( x^2 \\) by each term in \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\):\n- \\( x^2 * ax^2 = a x^4 \\)\n- \\( x^2 * bx = b x^3 \\)\n- \\( x^2 * c = c x^2 \\)\n\nNext, multiply \\( -3x \\) by each term in \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\):\n- \\( -3x * ax^2 = -3a x^3 \\)\n- \\( -3x * bx = -3b x^2 \\)\n- \\( -3x * c = -3c x \\)\n\nThen, multiply \\( 5 \\) by each term in \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\):\n- \\( 5 * ax^2 = 5a x^2 \\)\n- \\( 5 * bx = 5b x \\)\n- \\( 5 * c = 5c \\)\n\nNow, let's write down all these terms together:\n\n1. \\( a x^4 \\)\n2. \\( b x^3 \\)\n3. \\( c x^2 \\)\n4. \\( -3a x^3 \\)\n5. \\( -3b x^2 \\)\n6. \\( -3c x \\)\n7. \\( 5a x^2 \\)\n8. \\( 5b x \\)\n9. \\( 5c \\)\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\nFirst, for \\( x^4 \\):\n- Only term 1: \\( a x^4 \\)\n\nNext, \\( x^3 \\):\n- Term 2: \\( b x^3 \\)\n- Term 4: \\( -3a x^3 \\)\nSo, combined: \\( (b - 3a) x^3 \\)\n\nNext, \\( x^2 \\):\n- Term 3: \\( c x^2 \\)\n- Term 5: \\( -3b x^2 \\)\n- Term 7: \\( 5a x^2 \\)\nCombined: \\( (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 \\)\n\nNext, \\( x \\):\n- Term 6: \\( -3c x \\)\n- Term 8: \\( 5b x \\)\nCombined: \\( (-3c + 5b) x \\)\n\nFinally, constant term:\n- Term 9: \\( 5c \\)\n\nSo putting it all together, the product is:\n\n\\( a x^4 + (b - 3a) x^3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c \\)\n\nAnd this product equals the given quartic: \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nNow, let's set the coefficients equal for each power of \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, since the product must equal the given polynomial, their corresponding coefficients must match.\n\nStarting with the highest degree, which is \\( x^4 \\):\n\n1. Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\) in the product: \\( a \\)\n   - Coefficient in the given polynomial: 1\n   - So, equation: \\( a = 1 \\)\n\nNext, \\( x^3 \\):\n2. Coefficient in product: \\( b - 3a \\)\n   - Coefficient in given poly.: -3\n   - Equation: \\( b - 3a = -3 \\)\n   Since \\( a = 1 \\), substitute:\n   \\( b - 3(1) = -3 \\)\n   \\( b - 3 = -3 \\)\n   Add 3 to both sides: \\( b = 0 \\)\n\nHmm, so \\( b = 0 \\). Interesting, so the linear term in \\( p(x) \\) is zero. That might have been expected or not; let me keep going.\n\nNext, coefficient of \\( x^2 \\):\n3. Coefficient in product: \\( c - 3b + 5a \\)\n   - Coefficient in given poly.: 0 (since there is no \\( x^2 \\) term, it's implicitly 0)\n   So, equation: \\( c - 3b + 5a = 0 \\)\n   Substitute \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\):\n   \\( c - 0 + 5(1) = 0 \\)\n   \\( c + 5 = 0 \\)\n   Therefore, \\( c = -5 \\)\n\nOkay, moving on to the coefficient of \\( x \\):\n\n4. Coefficient in product: \\( -3c + 5b \\)\n   - Coefficient in given poly.: 15\n   So, equation: \\( -3c + 5b = 15 \\)\n   Substitute \\( b = 0 \\) and \\( c = -5 \\):\n   \\( -3*(-5) + 5*0 = 15 \\)\n   \\( 15 + 0 = 15 \\)\n   That's good, 15=15, which is consistent.\n\nLastly, the constant term:\n\n5. Coefficient in product: \\( 5c \\)\n   - Coefficient in given poly.: -25\n   So, equation: \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n   Substitute \\( c = -5 \\):\n   \\( 5*(-5) = -25 \\)\n   \\( -25 = -25 \\)\n   Perfect, that works out.\n\nSo, in summary, we found:\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = 0 \\)\n- \\( c = -5 \\)\n\nTherefore, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is:\n\n\\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = 1x^2 + 0x + (-5) = x^2 - 5 \\)\n\nLet me just verify this to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's multiply \\( x^2 - 3x +5 \\) by \\( x^2 - 5 \\) and check if we get the given quartic.\n\nMultiplying them together:\n\nFirst, \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)(x^2 - 5) \\)\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\n1. \\( x^2 * x^2 = x^4 \\)\n2. \\( x^2 * (-5) = -5x^2 \\)\n3. \\( -3x * x^2 = -3x^3 \\)\n4. \\( -3x * (-5) = 15x \\)\n5. \\( 5 * x^2 = 5x^2 \\)\n6. \\( 5 * (-5) = -25 \\)\n\nCombine these terms:\n\n\\( x^4 - 5x^2 - 3x^3 + 15x + 5x^2 -25 \\)\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n- \\( x^4 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 \\)\n- \\( (-5x^2 + 5x^2) = 0x^2 \\)\n- \\( 15x \\)\n- \\( -25 \\)\n\nSo the result is:\n\n\\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x -25 \\)\n\nWhich is exactly the given polynomial. So yes, that checks out. Therefore, my solution is correct.\n\nSo, to recap, by representing \\( p(x) \\) as a quadratic and matching coefficients, I found that \\( p(x) \\) is \\( x^2 - 5 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that\n\\[ (x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25, \\]\nwe start by noting that \\( p(x) \\) must be a quadratic polynomial, as the given polynomial is of degree 4 and we are multiplying by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\). Let \\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\).\n\nExpanding the product \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c)\\), we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c) &= x^2(ax^2 + bx + c) - 3x(ax^2 + bx + c) + 5(ax^2 + bx + c) \\\\\n&= a x^4 + b x^3 + c x^2 - 3a x^3 - 3b x^2 - 3c x + 5a x^2 + 5b x + 5c.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms, we have:\n\\[\na x^4 + (b - 3a) x^3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c.\n\\]\n\nWe compare this with the given polynomial \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) and set up the following equations by matching coefficients:\n1. Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\): \\( a = 1 \\)\n2. Coefficient of \\( x^3 \\): \\( b - 3a = -3 \\)\n3. Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\): \\( c - 3b + 5a = 0 \\)\n4. Coefficient of \\( x \\): \\( -3c + 5b = 15 \\)\n5. Constant term: \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\nSolving these equations step-by-step:\n1. From \\( a = 1 \\), we get \\( a = 1 \\).\n2. Substituting \\( a = 1 \\) into \\( b - 3a = -3 \\), we get \\( b - 3 = -3 \\) which gives \\( b = 0 \\).\n3. Substituting \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\) into \\( c - 3b + 5a = 0 \\), we get \\( c + 5 = 0 \\) which gives \\( c = -5 \\).\n4. Substituting \\( b = 0 \\) and \\( c = -5 \\) into \\( -3c + 5b = 15 \\), we verify \\( 15 = 15 \\).\n5. Substituting \\( c = -5 \\) into \\( 5c = -25 \\), we verify \\( -25 = -25 \\).\n\nThus, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\( x^2 - 5 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x^2 - 5}\n\\]<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>",

Hmm, okay. So, essentially, I have the equation:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25\n\\]\n\nMy goal is to solve for \\( p(x) \\). I think a good way to approach this is by performing polynomial division, right? Because if I divide the right-hand side polynomial by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\), the result should be \\( p(x) \\). \n\nLet me recall how polynomial division works. It's kind of like long division with numbers, but involving polynomials. The steps are to divide the leading term of the dividend by the leading term of the divisor, multiply the entire divisor by that result, subtract from the dividend, and repeat the process with the new polynomial. \n\nSo first, let me write down the dividend and the divisor more clearly. The dividend is \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25 \\) because I notice that the original right-hand side didn't have an \\( x^2 \\) term, so I'll include a zero coefficient for that to make it easier. The divisor is \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\nLet me set up the long division:\n\nDividing \\( x^4 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) gives me \\( x^2 \\). So, I write \\( x^2 \\) above the division line. Then, I multiply \\( x^2 \\) by the divisor \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\), which gives me:\n\n\\( x^2 \\times x^2 = x^4 \\),\n\\( x^2 \\times (-3x) = -3x^3 \\),\n\\( x^2 \\times 5 = 5x^2 \\).\n\nSo, that gives \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).\n\nNext, I subtract this result from the original dividend:\n\n\\( (x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x -25) - (x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2) \\).\n\nLet me subtract term by term:\n\n- \\( x^4 - x^4 = 0 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 - (-3x^3) = 0 \\)\n- \\( 0x^2 - 5x^2 = -5x^2 \\)\n- \\( 15x - 0x = 15x \\)\n- \\( -25 - 0 = -25 \\)\n\nSo, the subtraction results in \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nNow, I bring down the remaining terms, but in this case, all terms have been accounted for, so the next dividend is \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nNow, I divide the leading term \\( -5x^2 \\) by the leading term of the divisor \\( x^2 \\), which is \\( -5 \\). So, I write \\( -5 \\) as the next term in the quotient.\n\nThen, I multiply \\( -5 \\) by the divisor \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\):\n\n\\( -5 \\times x^2 = -5x^2 \\),\n\\( -5 \\times (-3x) = 15x \\),\n\\( -5 \\times 5 = -25 \\).\n\nSo, that gives \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nAgain, I subtract this from the current polynomial:\n\n\\( (-5x^2 + 15x -25) - (-5x^2 + 15x -25) = 0 \\).\n\nSo, there's no remainder left, which is great. That means the division comes out perfectly, and the quotient is what I've found so far: \\( x^2 - 5 \\).\n\nWait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the beginning: I divided \\( x^4 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( x^2 \\), then multiplied \\( x^2 \\) by the divisor, got \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\), subtract that from \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25 \\), which gave me \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\). Then, I divided \\( -5x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( -5 \\), multiplied it by the divisor: \\( -5x^2 +15x -25 \\), and subtracted to get a remainder of 0. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the polynomial \\( p(x) = x^2 - 5 \\). Let me just verify by multiplying \\( x^2 - 3x +5 \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\) to see if I get the original polynomial.\n\nLet me perform this multiplication:\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( x^4 \\).\n\nThen \\( x^2 \\times -5 \\) gives \\( -5x^2 \\).\n\nNow, multiply \\( -3x \\) by \\( x^2 \\): \\( -3x^3 \\).\n\nThen, \\( -3x \\times -5 \\): \\( +15x \\).\n\nNext, \\( 5 \\times x^2 \\): \\( 5x^2 \\).\n\n\\( 5 \\times -5 \\): \\( -25 \\).\n\nSo now, writing all these terms together:\n\n\\( x^4 -5x^2 -3x^3 +15x +5x^2 -25 \\).\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\n\\( x^4 -3x^3 + (-5x^2 +5x^2) +15x -25 \\).\n\nSimplifies to:\n\n\\( x^4 -3x^3 + 0x^2 +15x -25 \\).\n\nWhich is exactly \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\), which is the given polynomial. \n\nSo, that confirms that when I multiply \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\), I indeed get the desired result.\n\nTherefore, I think my solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25,\n\\]\n\nwe perform polynomial long division of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n1. Divide the leading term \\( x^4 \\) by the leading term \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( x^2 \\).\n2. Multiply \\( x^2 \\) by the divisor \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) to get \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).\n3. Subtract this result from the original polynomial:\n   \\[\n   (x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25) - (x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2) = -5x^2 + 15x - 25.\n   \\]\n4. Divide the leading term \\( -5x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( -5 \\).\n5. Multiply \\( -5 \\) by the divisor \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) to get \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\).\n6. Subtract this result from the previous remainder:\n   \\[\n   (-5x^2 + 15x - 25) - (-5x^2 + 15x - 25) = 0.\n   \\]\n\nThe quotient from the division is \\( x^2 - 5 \\), and there is no remainder. Verifying by multiplication confirms the result.\n\nThus, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\(\\boxed{x^2 - 5}\\).<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>",

Let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that if I have two polynomials multiplied together and the result is another polynomial, the degrees of the polynomials should add up. Let me check, the degree of \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) is 2, and we're looking for \\( p(x) \\). The product is \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\), which is a degree 4 polynomial. So, since \\( 2 + \\text{degree of } p = 4 \\), the degree of \\( p(x) \\) must be \\( 2 \\). That makes sense.

That way, I can set up equations for each coefficient and solve for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nLet me multiply \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) by \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\):\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 \\) by each term in \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\):\n- \\( x^2 \\times ax^2 = a x^4 \\)\n- \\( x^2 \\times bx = b x^3 \\)\n- \\( x^2 \\times c = c x^2 \\)\n\nNext, multiply \\( -3x \\) by each term:\n- \\( -3x \\times ax^2 = -3a x^3 \\)\n- \\( -3x \\times bx = -3b x^2 \\)\n- \\( -3x \\times c = -3c x \\)\n\nThen, multiply \\( 5 \\) by each term:\n- \\( 5 \\times ax^2 = 5a x^2 \\)\n- \\( 5 \\times bx = 5b x \\)\n- \\( 5 \\times c = 5c \\)\n\nNow let's write all these terms out:\n\n1. \\( a x^4 \\)\n2. \\( b x^3 + (-3a) x^3 \\) [since \\( b x^3 - 3a x^3 \\)]\n3. \\( c x^2 + (-3b) x^2 + 5a x^2 \\) [since \\( c x^2 - 3b x^2 + 5a x^2 \\)]\n4. \\( (-3c x) + (5b x) = (5b - 3c) x \\)\n5.

Let \\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\).\n\nWe multiply \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) by \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) and equate the coefficients of the resulting polynomial to those of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nExpanding the product:\n\n1. \\( x^2 \\times ax^2 = a x^4 \\)\n2. \\( x^2 \\times bx = b x^3 \\)\n3. \\( x^2 \\times c = c x^2 \\)\n4. \\( -3x \\times ax^2 = -3a x^3 \\)\n5. \\( -3x \\times bx = -3b x^2 \\)\n6. \\( -3x \\times c = -3c x \\)\n7. \\( 5 \\times ax^2 = 5a x^2 \\)\n8. \\( 5 \\times bx = 5b x \\)\n9. \\( 5 \\times c = 5c \\)\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n- The \\( x^4 \\) term: \\( a \\)\n- The \\( x^3 \\) terms: \\( b - 3a \\)\n- The \\( x^2 \\) terms: \\( c - 3b + 5a \\)\n- The \\( x \\) term: \\( 5b - 3c \\)\n- The constant term: \\( 5c \\)\n\nEquating these to the coefficients of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\):\n\n1. \\( a = 1 \\)\n2. \\( b - 3a = -3 \\)\n3. \\( c - 3b + 5a = 0 \\)\n4. \\( 5b - 3c = 15 \\)\n5. \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\nSolving these equations:\n\n1.

Checking consistency, \\( c - 3b + 5a = 0 \\) gives \\( -5 - 0 + 5(1) = 0 \\), which is true.\n\nThus, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\( x^2 - 5 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x^2 - 5}\n\\]<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>",
        "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c><\uff5cUser\uff5c>Please solve the following mathematical problem, placing your final answer within \\boxed{}:\nFind the polynomial $p(x)$ if\n$$(x^2-3x+5)p(x) = x^4-3x^3+15x-25.$$<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where I need to find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that when I multiply it by \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) \\), I get \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). Hmm, okay. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if I have two polynomials multiplied together and I can express one as the product of the other and another polynomial, division is the key. Since \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) \\) is a quadratic polynomial, and we're multiplying it by another polynomial \\( p(x) \\) to get a quartic (degree 4) polynomial. That means \\( p(x) \\) must be a quadratic polynomial itself because when you multiply a quadratic by a quadratic, you get a quartic.\n\nLet me write that down. If \\( p(x) \\) is quadratic, then I can express it as \\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\). Then, multiplying \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) \\) by \\( (ax^2 + bx + c) \\) should equal the given quartic. So, my goal is to find the coefficients \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nLet me set that up. The multiplication would look like:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c)\n\\]\n\nI need to expand this product and then equate it to the given polynomial \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). After expanding, I can compare coefficients of corresponding powers of \\( x \\) to set up equations for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nAlright, let's carry out the multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll distribute \\( ax^2 \\) across each term in the first polynomial:\n\n- \\( x^2 \\cdot ax^2 = a x^{4} \\)\n- \\( (-3x) \\cdot ax^2 = -3a x^{3} \\)\n- \\( 5 \\cdot ax^2 = 5a x^{2} \\)\n\nNext, distribute \\( bx \\) across each term in the first polynomial:\n\n- \\( x^2 \\cdot bx = b x^{3} \\)\n- \\( (-3x) \\cdot bx = -3b x^{2} \\)\n- \\( 5 \\cdot bx = 5b x \\)\n\nThen, distribute \\( c \\) across each term in the first polynomial:\n\n- \\( x^2 \\cdot c = c x^{2} \\)\n- \\( (-3x) \\cdot c = -3c x \\)\n- \\( 5 \\cdot c = 5c \\)\n\nNow, let's write all these terms out:\n\n1. \\( a x^{4} \\)\n2. \\( -3a x^{3} \\)\n3. \\( 5a x^{2} \\)\n4. \\( b x^{3} \\)\n5. \\( -3b x^{2} \\)\n6. \\( 5b x \\)\n7. \\( c x^{2} \\)\n8. \\( -3c x \\)\n9. \\( 5c \\)\n\nNext, I need to combine like terms.\n\nLooking for \\( x^{4} \\) terms: only the first term, which is \\( a x^{4} \\). So that coefficient is \\( a \\).\n\nFor \\( x^{3} \\) terms: we have \\( -3a x^{3} \\) and \\( b x^{3} \\), so when combined, it's \\( (-3a + b) x^{3} \\).\n\nFor \\( x^{2} \\) terms: \\( 5a x^{2} \\), \\( -3b x^{2} \\), and \\( c x^{2} \\), so combined, that's \\( (5a - 3b + c) x^{2} \\).\n\nFor \\( x \\) terms: \\( 5b x \\) and \\( -3c x \\), so combined, that's \\( (5b - 3c) x \\).\n\nAnd the constant term is just \\( 5c \\).\n\nSo summarizing, the entire expansion is:\n\n\\[\na x^{4} + (-3a + b) x^{3} + (5a - 3b + c)x^{2} + (5b - 3c) x + 5c\n\\]\n\nNow, we have this equal to the given polynomial \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). Let me write down that equation:\n\n\\[\na x^{4} + (-3a + b) x^{3} + (5a - 3b + c)x^{2} + (5b - 3c) x + 5c = x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25\n\\]\n\nWait a second, technically, the right-hand side doesn't show \\( x^2 \\) term, but technically, it's there with a coefficient of 0. That might be an important point. So, to properly set up the equations, I should compare coefficients for each degree.\n\nTherefore, the coefficients of corresponding powers must be equal. So, let's set them aside:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\):\n   \\( a = 1 \\) (Because RHS has 1 coefficient for \\( x^4 \\))\n\n2. Coefficient of \\( x^3 \\):\n   \\( -3a + b = -3 \\)\n\n3. Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\):\n   \\( 5a - 3b + c = 0 \\)\n\n4. Coefficient of \\( x \\):\n   \\( 5b - 3c = 15 \\)\n\n5. Constant term:\n   \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\nNow, that gives me a system of equations:\n\n1. \\( a = 1 \\)\n\n2. \\( -3a + b = -3 \\)\n\n3. \\( 5a - 3b + c = 0 \\)\n\n4. \\( 5b - 3c = 15 \\)\n\n5. \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\nAlright, let's solve this step by step.\n\nStarting with equation 1: \\( a = 1 \\). That\u2019s straightforward.\n\nMoving to equation 5: \\( 5c = -25 \\). Dividing both sides by 5, we get \\( c = -5 \\). So that gives us the value of \\( c \\).\n\nNow, let's plug \\( c = -5 \\) into equation 4: \\( 5b - 3c = 15 \\). Substituting:\n\n\\( 5b - 3*(-5) = 15 \\)\n\nCalculates to:\n\n\\( 5b + 15 = 15 \\)\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides: \\( 5b = 0 \\), so \\( b = 0 \\).\n\nOkay, now we have \\( b = 0 \\) and \\( c = -5 \\). Let's plug \\( a = 1 \\) into equation 2 to get \\( b \\). Wait, \\( a = 1 \\) and equation 2 is \\( -3a + b = -3 \\):\n\nSo, substituting \\( a = 1 \\):\n\n\\( -3(1) + b = -3 \\)\n\\( -3 + b = -3 \\)\nAdding 3 to both sides: \\( b = 0 \\). Okay, that matches the result from equation 4. Good, no contradictions there.\n\nNow, let's check equation 3: \\( 5a - 3b + c = 0 \\)\n\nWe know \\( a=1 \\), \\( b=0 \\), and \\( c=-5 \\):\n\n\\( 5(1) - 3(0) + (-5) = 5 - 0 -5 = 0 \\). Exactly, so equation 3 is satisfied.\n\nThus, all equations are consistent, and we have our values:\n\n\\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), \\( c = -5 \\)\n\nSo, putting it all together, the quadratic polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is:\n\n\\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = 1x^2 + 0x -5 = x^2 -5 \\)\n\nWait, hold on a moment. Let me just verify that to make sure we don't have a mistake.\n\nLet me compute \\( (x^2 - 3x +5)(x^2 -5) \\) and see if it equals \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\): that's \\( x^4 -5x^2 \\)\n\nNext, multiply \\( -3x \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\): that's \\( -3x^3 +15x \\)\n\nThen, multiply \\(5 \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\): that's \\( 5x^2 -25 \\)\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n\\( x^4 -5x^2 -3x^3 +15x +5x^2 -25 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- \\( x^4 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 \\)\n- \\( (-5x^2 +5x^2) = 0x^2 \\)\n- \\(15x \\)\n- \\( -25 \\)\n\nSo, the result is \\( x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25 \\). Which simplifies to \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\), which is exactly the polynomial we wanted. Perfect, so our solution is correct.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe we can perform polynomial long division as another method to see if \\( (x^2 - 3x +5) \\) divides into \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\) evenly, giving us \\( p(x) \\) as a quadratic.\n\nSo, if I perform \\( \\frac{x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25}{x^2 -3x +5} \\), the result should be \\( x^2 +0x -5 \\), which is \\( x^2 -5 \\).\n\nLet me set up the division:\n\nDivide \\( x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25 \\) by \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\).\n\n1. How many times does \\( x^2 \\) go into \\( x^4 \\)? It's \\( x^2 \\). Multiply \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\), which is \\( x^4 -3x^3 +5x^2 \\).\n\n2. Subtract this from the dividend:\n\n\\( (x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25) - (x^4 -3x^3 +5x^2) = 0x^4 +0x^3 -5x^2 +15x -25 \\)\n\n3. Now, bring down the next terms\u2014but here, all the coefficients are there, so move on.\n\n4. How many times does \\( x^2 \\) go into \\( -5x^2 \\)? It's \\(-5\\). Multiply \\( -5 \\) by \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\), which is \\( -5x^2 +15x -25 \\).\n\n5. Subtract this from the current dividend:\n\n\\( (-5x^2 +15x -25) - (-5x^2 +15x -25) = 0x^2 +0x +0 \\)\n\nSo, no remainder, which is perfect, and the quotient is \\( x^2 -5 \\), which again matches our previous result. So it's double-checked.\n\nAlternatively, if I am unsure, maybe I can try plugging in some values to see if both sides are equal.\n\nFor instance, let\u2019s pick x = 1.\n\nCompute LHS: \\( (1^2 -3*1 +5)(1^2 -5) = (1 -3 +5)(1 -5) = (3)(-4) = -12 \\)\n\nCompute RHS: \\(1^4 -3*1^3 +15*1 -25 =1 -3 +15 -25= (1 -3) + (15 -25) = (-2) + (-10)= -12 \\). So that works.\n\nLet me try another value, say x=2.\n\nCompute LHS: \\( (4 -6 +5)(4 -5)= (3)(-1)= -3 \\)\n\nCompute RHS: 16 -24 +30 -25= (16-24) + (30-25)= (-8)+(5)= -3. That works too.\n\nHow about x=0? Let me see.\n\nLHS: \\( (0 -0 +5)(0 -5)=5*(-5)= -25 \\)\n\nRHS: 0 +0 +0 -25= -25. That matches as well.\n\nAnother test at x= -1.\n\nLHS: (1 +3 +5)(1 -5)=9*(-4)= -36\n\nRHS: 1 +3 + (-15) -25=1 +3 -15 -25= 4 -40= -36. Perfect.\n\nSo, all tests are passing, confirming that our polynomial \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\nIs there another way to approach",

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I know that \\( p(x) \\) must be a polynomial because both \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) \\) and the result are polynomials. So, if I have a polynomial multiplied by a quadratic to get a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, that means \\( p(x) \\) must be a quadratic as well. Because if you multiply a quadratic by a quadratic, the highest degree term is 4. So, that suggests \\( p(x) \\) is a quadratic polynomial. \n\nLet me write that down. So, let me denote \\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants that I need to find. Got that.\n\nNow, the equation is \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). My task is to expand the left-hand side and then equate the coefficients with the right-hand side to find \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nSo, I'm going to proceed to expand \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c) \\).\n\nLet me recall that polynomial multiplication is done term by term. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and then like terms are combined.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n1. Multiply \\( x^2 \\) from the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\( x^2 \\cdot ax^2 = a x^{2+2} = a x^4 \\)\n   - \\( x^2 \\cdot bx = b x^{2+1} = b x^3 \\)\n   - \\( x^2 \\cdot c = c x^2 \\)\n\n2. Multiply \\( -3x \\) from the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\( -3x \\cdot ax^2 = -3a x^{1+2} = -3a x^3 \\)\n   - \\( -3x \\cdot bx = -3b x^{1+1} = -3b x^2 \\)\n   - \\( -3x \\cdot c = -3c x \\)\n\n3. Multiply \\( 5 \\) from the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\( 5 \\cdot ax^2 = 5a x^2 \\)\n   - \\( 5 \\cdot bx = 5b x \\)\n   - \\( 5 \\cdot c = 5c \\)\n\nNow, let me add up all these terms:\n\n- The \\( x^4 \\) term: \\( a x^4 \\)\n- The \\( x^3 \\) terms: \\( b x^3 - 3a x^3 \\) which combines to \\( (b - 3a) x^3 \\)\n- The \\( x^2 \\) terms: \\( c x^2 - 3b x^2 + 5a x^2 \\) which combines to \\( (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 \\)\n- The \\( x \\) terms: \\( -3c x + 5b x \\) which combines to \\( (-3c + 5b) x \\)\n- The constant term is \\( 5c \\ )\n\nSo, putting it all together, the expanded left-hand side becomes:\n\\( a x^4 + (b - 3a) x^3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c \\)\n\nNow, this must equal the right-hand side, which is \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). \n\nSo, let's write out the equation:\n\n\\[\na x^4 + (b - 3a) x^3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c = x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25\n\\]\n\nWait, hold on. When writing polynomials, the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) in the right-hand side is zero because there's no \\( x^2 \\) term. So I added \\( 0x^2 \\) to represent that. Similarly, the constants are 15 for \\( x \\) and -25 as the constant term.\n\nNow, since two polynomials are equal if and only if their corresponding coefficients of like terms are equal. So, let's set up equations for each coefficient:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\):\n   \\( a = 1 \\)\n\n2. Coefficient of \\( x^3 \\):\n   \\( b - 3a = -3 \\)\n\n3.

Okay, that's consistent.\n\nFinally, equation 5:\n\\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\\( c = -5 \\)\nWhich is the same result as above.\n\nSo, all equations are consistent, and we've got \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), \\( c = -5 \\).\n\nTherefore, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is:\n\n\\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = 1x^2 + 0x -5 = x^2 -5 \\)\n\nWait a minute, so \\( p(x) \\) is \\( x^2 - 5 \\)? Let me verify that.\n\nLet me multiply \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) \\) by \\( (x^2 -5) \\):\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 \\cdot x^2 = x^4 \\)\n\n\\( x^2 \\cdot (-5) = -5x^2 \\)\n\nThen, \\( -3x \\cdot x^2 = -3x^3 \\)\n\n\\( -3x \\cdot (-5) = 15x \\)\n\nThen, \\( 5 \\cdot x^2 = 5x^2 \\)\n\n\\( 5 \\cdot (-5) = -25 \\)\n\nNow, let me add all these together:\n\n- \\( x^4 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 \\)\n- \\( -5x^2 + 5x^2 = 0x^2 \\)\n- \\( 15x \\)\n- \\( -25 \\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x -25 \\), which is exactly the given polynomial.\n\nSo, indeed, \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\) is the correct polynomial.\n\nBut, just to double-check, maybe do the multiplication in a different way, maybe vertically.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n      x^2 - 3x + 5\n    *    x^2 - 5\n    ---------------\nMultiply each term:\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 -5 \\) by 5: 5*(x^2 -5) = 5x^2 -25\n\nThen, multiply \\( x^2 -5 \\) by (-3x): -3x*(x^2 -5) = -3x^3 +15x\n\nThen, multiply \\( x^2 -5 \\) by x^2: x^2*(x^2 -5) = x^4 -5x^2\n\nNow, add them all up:\n\nFirst term: x^4 -5x^2\nSecond term: -3x^3 +15x\nThird term: 5x^2 -25\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx^4: 1x^4\nx^3: -3x^3\nx^2: -5x^2 +5x^2 = 0\nx terms: 15x\nconstants: -25\n\nSo altogether:\nx^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 which matches.\n\nSo yeah, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use polynomial division? Let me think.\n\nIf I have \\( (x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25) \\) divided by \\( (x^2 -3x +5) \\), I should get \\( p(x) \\). Maybe checking through polynomial division.\n\nSo, dividing \\( x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25 \\) by \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\).

Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if I have two polynomials multiplied together resulting in another polynomial, I can use polynomial division to find one polynomial if I know the other. In this case, I have the divisor (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) and the dividend is the result, which is x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25. So, I guess I need to divide x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25 by (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) to get p(x).\n\nLet me write this out: p(x) = (x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25) divided by (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5). Dividing polynomials usually involves polynomial long division. I've heard of this before; it's similar to dividing numbers, but with polynomials. I need to make sure I line up the terms properly.\n\nFirst, let me write both polynomials with their degrees in order. The dividend is a quartic (degree 4), and the divisor is a quadratic (degree 2). So, in long division, the divisor goes into the dividend.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2003_______________\nx\u00b2 - 3x + 5 ) x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25\n\nWait, I notice that in the dividend, there's no x\u00b2 term. So I should insert a placeholder with coefficient zero to make it easier. So, the dividend becomes x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nNow, I'll start the division.\n\nFirst term: x\u2074 divided by x\u00b2 is x\u00b2. So, the first term of the quotient is x\u00b2.\n\nMultiply the entire divisor by x\u00b2: x\u00b2*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2.\n\nSubtract this from the dividend:\n\n(x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25) - (x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2) =\n\nx\u2074 - x\u2074 = 0\n\n-3x\u00b3 - (-3x\u00b3) = 0\n\n0x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 = -5x\u00b2\n\n15x remains.\n\n-25 remains.\n\nSo now, the new polynomial is -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nBring down the terms, but since we've subtracted completely, the next step is to divide this new polynomial by the divisor.\n\nNext term: -5x\u00b2 divided by x\u00b2 is -5.\n\nMultiply the divisor by -5: -5*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nSubtract this from the current polynomial:\n\n(-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) - (-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) = 0\n\nSo, there's no remainder.\n\nSo, adding the two terms, x\u00b2 and -5, gives the quotient as x\u00b2 -5.\n\nTherefore, p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\nLet me check if that's correct. Multiply p(x) by (x\u00b2 -3x +5) and see if we get x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25.\n\nWell, (x\u00b2 -5)(x\u00b2 -3x +5).\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nx\u00b2*(x\u00b2) = x\u2074\n\nx\u00b2*(-3x) = -3x\u00b3\n\nx\u00b2*5 =5x\u00b2\n\n-5*(x\u00b2) = -5x\u00b2\n\n-5*(-3x)=15x\n\n-5*5 = -25\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx\u2074\n\n-3x\u00b3\n\n5x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 =0x\u00b2\n\n15x\n\n-25\n\nSo, we get x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 +0x\u00b2 +15x -25, which is equal to the given dividend x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +0x\u00b2 +15x -25. That checks out. So p(x) is indeed x\u00b2 -5. Cool.\n\nWait, let me recap the division steps because I want to make sure I didn't make any mistake there.\n\n1. Checked if I have all the missing terms with zero coefficients, which I did.\n\n2. First term: x\u2074 divided by x\u00b2 is x\u00b2. Multiply divisor by x\u00b2 gives x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2.\n\n3. Subtracted that, got 0 for x\u2074 and x\u00b3, -5x\u00b2 remains because 0x\u00b2 was there and 5x\u00b2 was subtracted.\n\n4. Then, next term is -5x\u00b2 /x\u00b2 is -5. Multiply divisor by -5, which is -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\n5. Subtract that from the current -5x\u00b2 +15x -25, and everything cancels out, remainder zero.\n\nSo, quotient is x\u00b2 -5. Therefore, p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\nI was a bit nervous when subtracting the polynomials, but breaking it down step by step seems to hold. Let me just visualize the multiplication again:\n\n(x\u00b2 -5)(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = x\u00b2*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) -5*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 +15x -25. As you can see, 5x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 cancels, and then you're left with x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25, which is exactly the given polynomial.\n\nSo, yeah, I think I'm confident that p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25\\), we perform polynomial long division of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n1. **Set up the division**: Divide \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n2. **First term**: \\( x^4 \\) divided by \\( x^2 \\) gives \\( x^2 \\).\n3. **Multiply and subtract**: Multiply \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) to get \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).

Hmm, interesting. I'm going to need to figure out what p(x) is. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that if I have two polynomials multiplied together and that their product is given, I can find the unknown polynomial by division. So p(x) must be the result when I divide x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25 by x\u00b2 - 3x + 5. That makes sense because polynomial division is like the opposite of multiplication. So I can set this up as a long division problem.\n\nAlright, let me write down the division. The dividend is x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 + 15x - 25, wait, why 0x\u00b2? Oh, because in the original polynomial x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25, the x\u00b2 term is missing. So I need to include a zero coefficient for that term to make the division accurate. Otherwise, I might misalign terms later on.\n\nSo, the divisor is x\u00b2 - 3x + 5. Let's set up the long division: \n\nWe start by dividing the first term of the dividend, which is x\u2074, by the first term of the divisor, which is x\u00b2. That gives x\u00b2. So, the first term of the quotient is x\u00b2. Now, multiply the entire divisor by x\u00b2 to get x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 5x\u00b2. \n\nSubtracting this from the dividend, we have:\n\n(x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 + 15x - 25) minus (x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 5x\u00b2) equals 0x\u2074 + 0x\u00b3 -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nSo now, the new polynomial to work with is -5x\u00b2 +15x -25. Now, we take the first term of this, which is -5x\u00b2, and divide it by the first term of the divisor, which is x\u00b2. That gives us -5. So, the next term in the quotient is -5.\n\nMultiply the divisor by -5: -5x\u00b2 +15x -25. Subtract that from our current polynomial:\n\n(-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) minus (-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) equals 0x\u00b2 +0x +0.\n\nOh, wow, that subtracted perfectly with no remainder. So putting it all together, the quotient is x\u00b2 -5, and the remainder is zero, which is exactly what we needed. So p(x) must be x\u00b2 -5.\n\nBut wait, hold on a second. Let me just verify that I did everything correctly because sometimes math can be tricky. So, we constructed p(x) as x\u00b2 -5 and multiplied it by (x\u00b2 -3x +5) to see if we get the original polynomial.\n\nLet me do that multiplication step by step:\n\n(x\u00b2 -5)(x\u00b2 -3x +5). Let's distribute each term:\n\nFirst, x\u00b2*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2.\n\nThen, -5*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nNow, add those two results together:\n\nx\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-5x\u00b2 +5x\u00b2 cancels out, so 0x\u00b2. Then, we have x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Which is exactly the right-hand side of the equation given. That checks out.\n\nSo yes, p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25\\), we need to perform polynomial division of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n1. **Set up the division**: The dividend is \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25 \\) (including a placeholder for the missing \\( x^2 \\) term) and the divisor is \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n2. **First term of the quotient**: Divide the first term of the dividend \\( x^4 \\) by the first term of the divisor \\( x^2 \\), giving \\( x^2 \\).\n\n3. **Multiply and subtract**: Multiply the entire divisor by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).

It's similar to long division with numbers. So, I can start by writing it out step by step. First, I need to divide \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x -25 \\) (since there's no \\( x^2 \\) term) by \\( x^2 - 3x +5 \\).\n\nLet me set it up:\n\nDividend: \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x -25 \\)\nDivisor: \\( x^2 - 3x +5 \\)\n\nI start by dividing the leading term of the dividend \\( x^4 \\) by the leading term of the divisor \\( x^2 \\).

I divide the leading term \\( -5x^2 \\) by the leading term of the divisor \\( x^2 \\), which gives me \\( -5 \\). So, the next term in the quotient is \\( -5 \\).\n\nMultiply the divisor \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\) by \\( -5 \\):\n\\( -5 \\times (x^2 -3x +5) = -5x^2 +15x -25 \\).\n\nSubtracting this from the current polynomial:\n\\( (-5x^2 +15x -25 ) - (-5x^2 +15x -25) \\).\n\nCalculating term by term:\n- \\( -5x^2 - (-5x^2) = 0 \\)\n- \\( 15x - 15x = 0 \\)\n- \\( -25 - (-25) = 0 \\)\n\nSo, the remainder is zero. That means we're done.\n\nAdding up the terms we obtained in the quotient: \\( x^2 -5 \\). So, \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\).\n\nWait a second, let me check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

In this case, \\( p(x) \\) should be equal to \\( \\frac{x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25}{x^2 - 3x + 5} \\). That makes sense because division undoes multiplication.\n\nSo, maybe I can perform polynomial long division here. Let me set it up. I need to divide \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\). Let me write down the dividend and the divisor.\n\nDividing \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\). I notice that for clarity, I added a placeholder term \\( 0x^2 \\) for the missing \\( x^2 \\) term in the dividend. That way, I can systematically perform the division.\n\nOkay, starting with the first term of the dividend, \\( x^4 \\), and dividing it by the first term of the divisor, \\( x^2 \\). That gives me \\( x^2 \\). So, \\( x^2 \\) is the first term of the quotient \\( p(x) \\).\n\nNow, I multiply the entire divisor \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) which gives \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).\n\nNext, I subtract this result from the original dividend:\n\n\\( (x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25) - (x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2) \\)\n\nSubtracting term by term:\n\n- \\( x^4 - x^4 = 0 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 - (-3x^3) = 0 \\)\n- \\( 0x^2 - 5x^2 = -5x^2 \\)\n- \\( 15x - 0 = 15x \\)\n- \\( -25 - 0 = -25 \\)\n\nSo, the new polynomial after subtraction is \\( -5x^2 + 15x -25 \\).\n\nNow, I repeat the process with this new polynomial. Divide the first term \\( -5x^2 \\) by the first term of the divisor \\( x^2 \\), which gives me \\( -5 \\). So, the next term of the quotient is \\( -5 \\).\n\nNow, multiply the entire divisor by \\( -5 \\):\n\n\\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) * (-5) = -5x^2 + 15x -25 \\).\n\nSubtracting this from the previous remainder:\n\n\\( (-5x^2 +15x -25 ) - (-5x^2 +15x -25 ) \\)\n\nSubtracting term by term:\n\n- \\( -5x^2 - (-5x^2) = 0 \\)\n- \\( 15x -15x = 0 \\)\n- \\( -25 - (-25) =0 \\)\n\nSo, the remainder is 0.\n\nTherefore, the division is exact, and the quotient is the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) which we found through division. The quotient started as \\( x^2 \\) and then became \\( x^2 -5 \\) after the next term.\n\nSo, putting it all together, \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\).\n\nWait, let me verify this. If I multiply \\( (x^2 -3x +5) \\) by \\( (x^2 -5) \\), do I get \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\)?\n\nMultiplying \\( x^2 * x^2 = x^4 \\).\nThen, \\( x^2 * (-5) = -5x^2 \\).\nNext, \\( -3x * x^2 = -3x^3 \\).\nThen, \\( -3x * (-5) = 15x \\).\nNow, \\(5* x^2 =5x^2\\).\nThen,5* (-5) = -25.\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n- \\( x^4 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 \\)\n- \\( -5x^2 +5x^2 = 0x^2 \\)\n- \\( +15x \\)\n- \\( -25 \\)\n\nSo, the product is \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\), which is exactly what was given. Therefore, the division was correct, and p(x) is indeed \\( x^2 -5 \\).\n\nAnother way I thought about this problem is by factoring. I know that if we have \\( (x^2 -3x +5)p(x) = x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\), maybe we can factor the right-hand side. Sometimes factoring can reveal the structure needed.\n\nLet me try to factor \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\). Hmm, factoring quartic polynomials can be tricky, but maybe it's a product of quadratics or something. Alternatively, perhaps it can be factored as the product of \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\) and another quadratic. Let me check.\n\nLet\u2019s assume \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 = (x^2 -3x +5)(px^2 + qx + r) \\). If I can find p, q, r such that this holds, then that will help me get p(x). Alternatively, p is the quadratic we just found, but to see whether this works.\n\nMultiplying out the right-hand side:\n\n\\( (x^2 -3x +5)(px^2 + qx + r) \\)\n= \\( x^2(px^2 + qx + r) -3x(px^2 + qx + r) + 5(px^2 + qx + r) \\)\n= \\( px^4 + qx^3 + rx^2 -3px^3 -3qx^2 -3rx +5px^2 +5qx +5r \\)\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\n- \\( x^4: p \\)\n- \\( x^3: q -3p \\)\n- \\( x^2: r -3q +5p \\)\n- \\( x: -3r +5q \\)\n- Constant term: 5r\n\nNow, the left-hand side is \\( x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25 \\). So, setting up equations by equating coefficients:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\): p =1\n2. Coefficient of \\( x^3 \\): q -3p = -3\n3. Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\): r -3q +5p =0\n4. Coefficient of \\( x \\): -3r +5q =15\n5. Constant term: 5r = -25\n\nSo, let's solve these equations:\n\nFrom equation 1: p =1\n\nFrom equation 2: q -3(1) = -3 \u2192 q -3 = -3 \u2192 q=0\n\nFrom equation 5: 5r = -25 \u2192 r = -5\n\nNow, from equation 3: r -3q +5p = (-5) -0 +5(1) =0? Let's test:\n\nr -3q +5p = -5 -0 +5 =0, which is correct.\n\nAnd from equation 4: -3r +5q = -3(-5) + 0 =15, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, p=1, q=0, r=-5.\n\nTherefore, the quadratic factor is \\( x^2 +0x -5 =x^2 -5 \\). So, indeed, \\( p(x)=x^2 -5 \\). Therefore, factoring confirms the division result.\n\nAnother method I could consider is using synthetic division or other factoring techniques, but since both polynomial division and factoring lead me to the same result, I\u2019m confident that \\( p(x) =x^2 -5 \\).\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can graph both polynomials and see if their product makes sense, but graphing often isn't necessary if all the algebraic methods confirm the solution.\n\nAlternatively, I can plug in a value for x into both sides and verify.\n\nLet\u2019s pick x=1:\n\nCompute LHS: (1^2 -3*1 +5)*p(1) = (1 -3 +5)*p(1)=3*p(1)\nCompute RHS:1^4 -3*1^3 +15*1 -25 =1 -3 +15 -25= (1-3)= -2, (-2 +15)=13, (13-25)=-12. So RHS value at x=1 is -12.\nThus, 3*p(1)=-12, so p(1)= -4.\n\nNow, p(x)=x^2 -5, so p(1)=1 -5= -4. It matches.\n\nAnother test with x=2:\n\nLHS: (4 -6 +5)*p(2)= (3)*p(2)\nRHS:16 -24 +30 -25= (16-24)= -8, (-8+30)=22, (22-25)= -3. So RHS at x=2 is -3.\nTherefore, 3*p(2)= -3, so p(2)= -1.\n\nCompute p(2)= 4 -5= -1. That checks out.\n\nOne more test with x=0:\n\nLHS: (0 -0 +5)*p(0)=5*p(0)\nRHS:0 -0 +0 -25= -25. So, 5*p(0)= -25, p(0)= -5.\n\nCompute p(0)=0 -5= -5. That also works.\n\nSo, all my test points are satisfied, which adds more confidence that p(x)=x^2 -5 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way is to notice that the given polynomial x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 might be factorable into two quadratics, one of which is x^2 -3x +5, so if I can factor it, that gives me p(x).\n\nBut perhaps an even quicker check is to plug in x= something that makes p(x) zero or something, but maybe not necessary here since the previous thoroughness is sufficient.\n\nThinking through, am I making any incorrect assumptions? The original setup is a product of polynomials and getting the quotient by division, but since both polynomials have integer coefficients, it's likely to be with lesser chance of error. Moreover, synthetic division would be faster if I thought in terms of factoring in (x - a), but in this case, since it's a quadratic, it's a bit more involved.\n\nBut as I already confirmed with factoring by coefficient comparison, it's sufficient. So, I think I'm confident that p(x)=x\u00b2 -5 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, just one thing\u2014when I first thought of polynomial division, I said the process, but then I thought of factoring, so maybe someone might get confused whether the factoring is necessary or not.\n\nBut in this case, since the question is phrased as multiplying p(x) and (x\u00b2 -3x +5), so actually, it's possible to state that p(x) is equal to the division. Thus, either method works.\n\nBut perhaps factoring can be a method in cases when known factors are present. For example, if both the dividend and divisor had some common factor, but in this case, I don't think that's applicable.\n\nAnother thought: maybe sometimes polynomials can have multiple factors or roots, but in this case, since the divisor is quadratic, and having found the other quadratic factor, that's sufficient. And it's another good check that after multiplying the two quadratics, one of them being known, I get back the dividend.\n\nThus, all in all, I think I\u2019ve approached the problem in multiple ways, and all confirm that \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\), we need to perform polynomial division of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n1. Divide \\( x^4 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( x^2 \\).\n2. Multiply \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) to get \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).\n3.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) \\) is a quadratic polynomial, and the product is a quartic polynomial (since the highest degree is 4). That makes sense because multiplying a quadratic by another quadratic would give a quartic. But in this case, \\( p(x) \\) must be a quadratic polynomial as well because \\( (x^2)(x^2) = x^4 \\).

Hmm, okay. Let's see. I guess p(x) must be a polynomial as well, right? Because if I multiply (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) by p(x) and get a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, then p(x) has to be a quadratic (degree 2), since 2 (from x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) plus 2 (from p(x)) equals 4. That makes sense.\n\nSo, let me write p(x) as a general quadratic: p(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c. That seems like a good start because it covers all possibilities for a second-degree polynomial.\n\nNow, the equation given is (x\u00b2 - 3x +5)(ax\u00b2 + bx + c) = x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Okay, so if I multiply these two polynomials together, I should end up with that result. Therefore, I can expand the left-hand side and then set the coefficients equal to those on the right-hand side. Since the coefficients of corresponding powers of x must be equal for the two polynomials to be equal, I can set up equations and solve for a, b, and c.\n\nLet me go ahead and perform that multiplication. I'll multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.\n\nFirst, take x\u00b2 multiplied by each term in p(x):\n\n- x\u00b2 * ax\u00b2 = a x\u2074\n- x\u00b2 * bx = b x\u00b3\n- x\u00b2 * c = c x\u00b2\n\nThen, take -3x multiplied by each term in p(x):\n\n- -3x * ax\u00b2 = -3a x\u00b3\n- -3x * bx = -3b x\u00b2\n- -3x * c = -3c x\n\nNext, take +5 multiplied by each term in p(x):\n\n- 5 * ax\u00b2 = 5a x\u00b2\n- 5 * bx = 5b x\n- 5 * c = 5c\n\nNow, let's combine all those terms:\n\n= a x\u2074\n+ b x\u00b3 + c x\u00b2\n-3a x\u00b3 -3b x\u00b2 -3c x\n+5a x\u00b2 +5b x +5c\n\nNow, let's collect like terms:\n\n- x\u2074 term: a x\u2074\n- x\u00b3 terms: b x\u00b3 - 3a x\u00b3\n- x\u00b2 terms: c x\u00b2 -3b x\u00b2 +5a x\u00b2\n- x terms: -3c x +5b x\n- constant term: 5c\n\nSo, writing it all together:\n\n= a x\u2074 + (b - 3a) x\u00b3 + (c -3b +5a) x\u00b2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c\n\nNow, we know this is equal to x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. So, to find coefficients, let's set the coefficients equal for each power of x:\n\nFor x\u2074: a = 1\n\nFor x\u00b3: (b - 3a) = -3\n\nFor x\u00b2: (c - 3b +5a) = 0 (since there's no x\u00b2 term on the right side)\n\nFor x: (-3c +5b) = 15\n\nFor constant term: 5c = -25\n\nOkay, so that gives us a system of equations:\n\n1. a = 1\n\n2. b - 3a = -3\n\n3. c - 3b +5a = 0\n\n4. -3c +5b = 15\n\n5. 5c = -25\n\nAlright, let's solve these equations step by step starting from the first equation.\n\nEquation 1: a = 1. So, a is 1. That's straightforward.\n\nMoving to Equation 5: 5c = -25; so, divide both sides by 5, c = -25 / 5 = -5. So, c = -5.\n\nNow that we have a=1 and c=-5, let's plug into Equation 2: Equation 2 says b -3a = -3.\n\nSubstituting a=1, we get: b -3(1) = -3 => b -3 = -3 => b = 0\n\nWait, b = 0?\n\nLet me pause. Let me write down all these steps when plugging in:\n\nEquation 2: b -3a = -3\n\nWith a=1: b - 3(1) = -3 => b -3 = -3 => b = -3 +3 => b=0. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo, b=0. Okay, moving to Equation 3: c -3b +5a = 0.\n\nWe know c=-5, b=0, a=1, so:\n\n-5 -3(0) +5(1) = 0 => -5 +0 +5 = 0 => 0=0. Perfect, it holds.\n\nNow, let's move to Equation 4: -3c +5b = 15.\n\nPlug in c=-5, b=0:\n\n-3(-5)+5(0)=15 =>15 +0=15=>15=15. Also holds.\n\nHmm, so all the equations are consistent. So, we have a=1, b=0, c=-5.\n\nTherefore, the quadratic polynomial p(x)= ax\u00b2 +bx +c=1 x\u00b2 +0x -5 => x\u00b2 - 5.\n\nWait a second. Is that it? So, p(x)=x\u00b2 -5? Hmm. Let me verify.\n\nLet me multiply (x\u00b2 -3x +5) by (x\u00b2 -5) and see if I get the given quartic.\n\nSo, let's do that.\n\n(x\u00b2 -3x +5)(x\u00b2 -5). Let's compute term by term.\n\nFirst, x\u00b2 * x\u00b2 =x\u2074\n\nx\u00b2 * (-5)= -5x\u00b2\n\nThen, -3x *x\u00b2= -3x\u00b3\n\n-3x*(-5)=15x\n\nThen, +5* x\u00b2=5x\u00b2\n\n+5*(-5)= -25\n\nSo, combining all those:\n\nx\u2074 -5x\u00b2 -3x\u00b3 +15x +5x\u00b2 -25\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\nx\u2074 (only term)\n\n-3x\u00b3 (only term)\n\nThen, (-5x\u00b2 +5x\u00b2)=0x\u00b2\n\n15x (only term)\n\n-25 (constant term)\n\nSo, total polynomial is x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Which is exactly the given polynomial on the right-hand side.\n\nWow, that's perfect. So, my values of a=1, b=0, c=-5 result in p(x) = x\u00b2 -5, and this works.\n\nSo, therefore, p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\nWait, maybe I should write p(x)=x\u00b2 -5 to make sure it's correct.\n\nBut let me just double-check my multiplication:\n\n(x\u00b2 -3x +5)(x\u00b2 -5) = x\u2074 -5x\u00b2 -3x\u00b3 +15x +5x\u00b2 -25. The x\u00b2 terms cancel out, and the rest gives x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Yes, that's exactly what we needed. So, seems correct.\n\nSo, like I thought, when we had a=1, b=0, c=-5, everything worked out. So, yeah, p(x) is definitely x\u00b2 -5. I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, maybe I can notice if the polynomials could have been factored or had some factors canceled, but (x\u00b2 -3x +5) is not factorable over the reals, as discriminant is 9 -20 = -11 <0, so it can't be factored into real linear terms.\n\nAlso, the right-hand side, x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Let me see, does that factor? Maybe if we can factor it into (x\u00b2 -3x +5) multiplied by something else, which we just did, but I think it's more work than I need.\n\nGiven that when I multiplied (x\u00b2 -3x +5)*(x\u00b2 -5) I got the exact polynomial on the right, then p(x) must be x\u00b2 -5.\n\nI think that\u2019s solid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is p(x) = x\u00b2 -5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25\\), we assume \\( p(x) \\) is a quadratic polynomial of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\).\n\nExpanding \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c)\\) and combining like terms, we get:\n\\[\na x^4 + (b - 3a) x^3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c\n\\]\n\nWe compare this with the given polynomial \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) and set up the following system of equations by equating the coefficients of corresponding powers of \\( x \\):\n1. \\( a = 1 \\)\n2. \\( b - 3a = -3 \\)\n3. \\( c - 3b + 5a = 0 \\)\n4. \\( -3c + 5b = 15 \\)\n5. \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\nSolving these equations step by step:\n1. From \\( a = 1 \\), we have \\( a = 1 \\).\n2. From \\( 5c = -25 \\), we get \\( c = -5 \\).\n3. Substituting \\( a = 1 \\) into \\( b - 3a = -3 \\), we get \\( b = 0 \\).\n4. Verifying with equations 3 and 4, we find that they hold true with \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), and \\( c = -5 \\).\n\nThus, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is:\n\\[\np(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = x^2 - 5\n\\]\n\nTo verify, we multiply \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)(x^2 - 5)\\) and confirm it results in \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nTherefore, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>"

Hmm, alright, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that an even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in its domain, and an odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). That means, for \\( f \\), swapping the sign of the input doesn't change the output, but for \\( g \\), it flips the sign of the output when the input is negated.\n\nNow, the function in question is \\( f(g(x^3)) \\). I need to determine if this is even, odd, or neither. To check that, I should see if \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\) relates to \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) in a way that fits the definitions.\n\nLet me compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\). First, notice that \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\) because raising a negative to an odd power keeps it negative. So, inside the function \\( g \\), we have \\( g(-x^3) \\).\n\nSince \\( g \\) is an odd function, \\( g(-y) = -g(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). Let me substitute \\( y = x^3 \\), so \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).\n\nNow, substitute this back into the original expression: \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n\nSince \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-z) = f(z) \\) for any \\( z \\). Letting \\( z = g(x^3) \\), it follows that \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nPutting this all together, we have \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), which is \\( f(g(x^3)) \\). This means that the function \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\) satisfies \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), because \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n\nTherefore, by definition, \\( h(x) \\) is an even function.\n\nWait, did I skip any steps? Let me check again.\n\n1. Start with \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n2. Compute \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\).\n3. Simplify the inside: \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\), so \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n4. Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\), so \\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n5. Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n6. That is \\( f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n7. So, \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), which means \\( h \\) is even.\n\nYep, that all checks out. So, whether I cube \\( x \\), apply the odd function \\( g \\), which flips the sign, and then apply the even function \\( f \\), which doesn't care about the sign, results in the overall function being even.\n\nI don't think I made a mistake here. It makes sense because the composition essentially neutralizes the effect of the odd function because of the even function wrapping around it. So, the result is symmetric, hence even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1.

So, let's start by recalling some basic definitions to get a grip on this.\n\nAn even function satisfies the condition \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in its domain. On the other hand, an odd function meets the condition \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in its domain. Okay, so that's clear. Now, in this problem, we\u2019re dealing with compositions of functions, which can sometimes be tricky, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me establish what we know:\n\n1. \\( f(x) \\) is an even function. That means \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\).\n2. \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, so \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n3. We need to analyze the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) and determine if it's even, odd, or neither.\n\nAlright, let's tackle the composition step by step. Let me define a new function \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\) to make things clearer. The question is whether \\( h(-x) \\) equals \\( h(x) \\) (even), \\( -h(x) \\) (odd), or something else.\n\nSo, to figure out what kind of function \\( h(x) \\) is, let's compute \\( h(-x) \\) and see how it relates to \\( h(x) \\). Let's do that step by step.\n\nStart with \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\). Let's simplify the inner part first. \\( (-x)^3 \\) is equal to \\( -x^3 \\), right? Since when you raise a negative number to an odd power, it remains negative. So, \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\). Therefore, the expression becomes:\n\n\\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n\nNow, I remember that \\( g(x) \\) is odd, so substituting \\( -x^3 \\) into \\( g \\) should give us \\( -g(x^3) \\). Let's write that down:\n\n\\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for \\( h(-x) \\):\n\n\\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n\nHmm, so we have \\( f(-g(x^3)) \\) now. Here, \\( f(x) \\) is even. What happens when we plug in \\( -g(x^3) \\) into an even function?\n\nSince \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). So, if we let \\( y = g(x^3) \\), then:\n\n\\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nBut wait, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is exactly our original function \\( h(x) \\). So, substituting that back:\n\n\\( h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n\nSo, \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), which per the definitions, means that \\( h(x) \\) is even.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any steps or assumptions. Let's go step by step again.\n\n1. \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n2. To find if \\( h(-x) \\) equals \\( h(x) \\) or \\( -h(x) \\), compute \\( h(-x) \\):\n   - \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n3. Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\):\n   - \\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n4. Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n5. Thus, \\( h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n\nYes, everything checks out. So, each step holds. So, the composition \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\nWait another thought\u2014is the composition of an even and an odd function necessarily even or could it vary? Let's think.\n\nSuppose \\( f \\) is even and \\( g \\) is odd. Then, when you compose them, the inside function is odd (\\( g(x^3) \\). But since \\( x^3 \\) is also an odd function (because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\)), composing an odd function \\( g \\) with another odd function \\( x^3 \\) gives us \\( g(x^3) \\) as odd?\n\nWait, hold on: is \\( g(x^3) \\) even, odd, or neither?\n\nIf \\( g \\) is odd, then \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). So, let's compute \\( g((-x)^3) = g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\), because \\( g \\) is odd. So, \\( g(x^3) \\) is an odd function, because \\( g((-x)^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, the inner function \\( g(x^3) \\) is odd.\n\nSo, now, \\( f \\) maps this intermediate odd function. So, \\( h(x) = f \\) (something odd). Since \\( f \\) is even, how does it interact with an odd input?\n\nLet's note that even functions take care of the sign, so \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\). Therefore, no matter if the input to \\( f \\) is odd or not, \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\). So, even when the input is odd, you still get the same value as when you input the positive version.\n\nSo, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), leading to \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), as established before.\n\nBut hold on, let me consider specific examples to verify my conclusion because sometimes these properties can be counter-intuitive.\n\nSuppose \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\), which is odd. Then, computing \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\), which is \\( (x^3)^2 = x^6 \\). Is \\( x^6 \\) even? Yes, because any even power of \\( x \\) is an even function.\n\nAlternatively, take another even function, say \\( f(x) = \\cos(x) \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = \\sin(x) \\), which is odd. Then, \\( h(x) = \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\). Then, \\( h(-x) = \\cos(\\sin((-x)^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(-x^3)) = \\cos(-\\sin(x^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\), because cosine is an even function. Therefore, \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so it is even as well.\n\nBut wait, let me think if I can get an example where the composition is neither even nor odd. Let me see.\n\nSuppose \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x + x^3 \\). Is \\( g(x) \\) odd? Let's check \\( g(-x) = (-x) + (-x)^3 = -x - x^3 = - (x + x^3) = -g(x) \\), so yes, \\( g \\) is odd.\n\nThen \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) = (g(x^3))^2 = (x^3 + (x^3)^3)^2 = (x^3 + x^9)^2 \\). Let me test \\( h(-x) = (-x^3 + (-x^9))^2 = (-x^3 - x^9)^2 = (x^3 + x^9)^2 = h(x) \\). So, still, it's even. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need a different example where maybe \\( f \\) isn't just a power function. Let me take \\( f(x) = |x| \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\), which is odd. Then, \\( h(x) = |x^3| \\). Now, \\( |(-x)^3| = | -x^3 | = |x^3| \\), so \\( h(-x) = |x^3| = h(x) \\), which is still even.\n\nIs there a scenario where the composition would be odd?\n\nWait, for \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) to be odd, we need \\( f(g(-x^3)) = -f(g(x^3)) \\), but since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), so for the antipodal condition to hold, \\( f(g(-x^3)) = -f(g(x^3)) \\) meaning \\( f(-g(x^3)) = -f(g(x^3)) \\), which would only require that \\( f(-y) = -f(y) \\) for \\( y = g(x^3) \\), but since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\). Therefore, unless \\( f(y) \\) is also odd for all \\( y \\), the equality may not hold. But \\( f \\) is given as even, not odd.\n\nTherefore, in general, unless \\( f \\) is both even and odd, which is only possible if it's the zero function, it's impossible for the composition to be odd because \\( f \\) being even forces \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), making \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), hence even.\n\nTherefore, my earlier conclusion seems solid.\n\nSo, summarizing the steps:\n\n- Start with \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n- Compute \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n- Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).\n- Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n- Therefore, \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so \\( h(x) \\) is even.\n\nI think that checks out. I considered some specific examples, and in each case, the composition came out even. I also stepped through the general case again without seeing any contradictions, which supports my conclusion.\n\nSo, to wrap it up, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is an even function.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) ) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1. An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\).\n2. An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\nTo analyze the composition \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\), we compute \\( h(-x) \\):\n\n\\[\nh(-x) = f(g((-x)^3))\n\\]\n\nSince \\((-x)^3 = -x^3\\), we have:\n\n\\[\nh(-x) = f(g(-x^3))\n\\]\n\nBecause \\( g \\) is an odd function:\n\n\\[\ng(-x^3) = -g(x^3)\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\nh(-x) = f(-g(x^3))\n\\]\n\nSince \\( f \\) is an even function:\n\n\\[\nf(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3))\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\nh(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x)\n\\]\n\nThis shows that \\( h(x) \\) is even.

Hmm, okay, let's unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that even functions satisfy \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in their domain. Examples are things like \\( x^2 \\) or cosine functions. On the other hand, odd functions satisfy \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). Examples of odd functions include \\( x^3 \\) or sine functions.\n\nSo, we have \\( f \\) being even, \\( g \\) being odd. The composite function we're looking at is \\( f(g(x^3)) \\). Let me write this out: \\( f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nI need to figure out if this composite function is even, odd, or neither. To do that, I should check the definition of even and odd for composite functions. That is, I should find \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\) and compare it to \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) and see if it equals either \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) or \\( -f(g(x^3)) \\), or neither.\n\nLet's compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\).\n\nFirst, calculate \\( (-x)^3 \\). That's \\( -x^3 \\). So, we have \\( g(-x^3) \\).\n\nBut since \\( g \\) is an odd function, \\( g(-y) = -g(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). Let me substitute \\( y = x^3 \\) here. So, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, \\( f(g(-x^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n\nNow, since \\( f \\) is an even function, \\( f(-z) = f(z) \\) for any \\( z \\). Let me denote \\( z = g(x^3) \\), then \\( f(-z) = f(z) \\).\n\nSo, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). Putting it all together, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). Therefore, the function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) satisfies \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), which is the definition of an even function.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I started by evaluating \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\), which breaks down to \\( f(-g(x^3)) \\) because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\) and \\( g \\) is odd. Then, since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). So the composition is even. Hmm, seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can test it with specific examples to make sure.\n\nLet's take \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) (which is even) and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\) (which is odd). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = (x^3)^2 = x^6 \\). Is \\( x^6 \\) even or odd? Well, substituting \\( -x \\) gives \\( (-x)^6 = x^6 \\), so yes, it's even. So in this case, it's even.\n\nAnother example: Let \\( f(x) = \\cos(x) \\) (which is even) and \\( g(x) = \\sin(x) \\) (which is odd). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\). Let's check if this is even or odd. Compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = \\cos(\\sin((-x)^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(-x^3)) \\). Since \\( \\sin(-x^3) = -\\sin(x^3) \\) (because sine is odd), then \\( \\cos(-\\sin(x^3)) \\). Cosine is an even function, so \\( \\cos(-a) = \\cos(a) \\), so this becomes \\( \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\). Therefore, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), so this composite function is also even. Interesting.\n\nWait, is that always the case, regardless of the specific even and odd functions? Let me test another example. Maybe with \\( f(x) = x^4 \\) (even) and \\( g(x) = x^5 \\) (odd). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = (x^5)^4 = x^{20} \\), which is even because \\( (-x)^{20} = x^{20} \\). Seems okay.\n\nPerhaps an even function that's not just a power, and an odd function that isn't a power. Let's see, \\( f(x) = e^{x^2} \\) (which is even since \\( e^{(-x)^2} = e^{x^2} \\)) and \\( g(x) = \\sin(x) \\) (which is odd). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = e^{(\\sin(x^3))^2} \\). Let's check if this is even: Replace \\( x \\) with \\( -x \\) and see if equality holds.\n\n\\( f(g((-x)^3)) = e^{(\\sin((-x)^3))^2} = e^{(\\sin(-x^3))^2} \\). Since sine is odd, \\( \\sin(-x^3) = -\\sin(x^3) \\). So squaring it, \\( (-\\sin(x^3))^2 = (\\sin(x^3))^2 \\). Therefore, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = e^{(\\sin(x^3))^2} = f(g(x^3)) \\). So again it's even.\n\nHmm, seems that across the board it's even.\n\nAlternatively, let me try if \\( g(x) \\) isn't odd but even, just for testing. Wait, but in this problem, \\( g \\) is odd. So if I wouldn't get the right result? Anyway, in our problem \\( g \\) is odd, so that's consistent.\n\nLet me try another example where \\( f \\) is even, but \\( g \\) is different. Say \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), \\( g(x) = x^3 + x \\), which is odd because \\( g(-x) = -x^3 -x = -(x^3 + x) = -g(x) \\). Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = (x^3 + x)^2 = x^6 + 2x^4 + x^2 \\). Test whether this is even: substitute \\( -x \\): \\( (-x)^6 + 2(-x)^4 + (-x)^2 = x^6 + 2x^4 + x^2 \\), which is the same as before. So yes, it's even.\n\nAlternatively, take a non-algebraic even function. Suppose \\( f(x) = |x| \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\), which is odd. Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = |g(x^3)| = |x^9| = |x|^9 \\). Wait, is that even or odd?\n\n\\( |x^9| = |x|^9 \\). Then evaluating at \\( -x \\): \\( |(-x)^9| = | -x^9 | = |x|^9 \\). So they are equal, so \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even again.\n\nWait, so in all these examples, it's even. So is there a reason why? Let's see:\n\n1. Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\n2. Then \\( g(x^3) \\) as is: for any \\( x \\), \\( g(x^3) \\) is... wait, it's not straightforwardly odd or even because \\( x^3 \\) is odd.\n\nWait, but if \\( g \\) is odd, then \\( g(x^3) \\) is still a function, right? Let me check if \\( g(x^3) \\) is even or odd. Let's consider \\( h(x) = g(x^3) \\). Is \\( h(-x) = -h(x) \\) or \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\)?\n\nCompute \\( h(-x) = g((-x)^3) = g(-x^3) \\). But since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). So \\( h(-x) = -g(x^3) = -h(x) \\). Therefore, \\( h(x) = g(x^3) \\) is an odd function.\n\nSo in reality, after the substitution, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) becomes \\( f(h(x)) \\) where \\( h(x) \\) is odd.\n\nNow, since \\( f \\) is even, what happens when we plug an odd function into an even function? Let me recall:\n\nIf \\( h(x) \\) is odd, \\( h(-x) = -h(x) \\). So \\( f(h(-x)) = f(-h(x)) \\). Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-h(x)) = f(h(x)) \\). Therefore, \\( f(h(-x)) = f(h(x)) \\), which means \\( f \\circ h \\) is even, because \\( (f \\circ h)(-x) = (f \\circ h)(x) \\).\n\nTherefore, yes, the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it:\n\nLet me denote \\( y = x^3 \\). Then \\( f(g(y)) \\). Since \\( y = x^3 \\), which has a power of 3. So if I replace \\( x \\) with \\( -x \\), \\( y \\) becomes \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\). So then \\( f(g(-x^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\) because \\( g \\) is odd. And since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). Hence, \\( f(g(x^3)) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\), so the function is even.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the specific even and odd functions chosen, as long as \\( f \\) is even and \\( g \\) is odd, the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) ends up being even.\n\nIs there a situation when this might not hold? Maybe if \\( f \\) or \\( g \\) are not injective or something? Hmm, but the property doesn't depend on injectivity or surjectivity because it's based solely on the functional equations \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) and \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). So since these properties hold for all \\( x \\), regardless of specific behavior, then the composition will always satisfy \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\) making it even.\n\nTherefore, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is an even function.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1. **Properties of Even and Odd Functions**:\n   - An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\).\n   - An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the Composite Function**:\n   - We need to check if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even or odd.\n   - Consider \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\).

        "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c><\uff5cUser\uff5c>Please solve the following mathematical problem, placing your final answer within \\boxed{}:\nIf $f(x)$ is an even function and $g(x)$ is an odd function, find if $f(g(x^3))$ is even, odd, or neither.\n\nEnter \"odd\", \"even\", or \"neither\".<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, let's see. I have this math problem here: If f(x) is an even function and g(x) is an odd function, find if f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, odd, or neither. Hmm, I remember that even and odd functions have specific properties, so maybe I can use those to figure it out.\n\nFirst off, let's recall what even and odd functions are. An even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain. So, if I plug in -x, it's the same as plugging in x. Classic examples are functions like f(x) = x\u00b2 or cosine functions.\n\nOn the other hand, an odd function satisfies g(-x) = -g(x). So, flipping the sign of x flips the sign of the output. Examples include g(x) = x\u00b3 or sine functions.\n\nAlright, so in this problem, f is even, g is odd. I need to compute whether the composition f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, odd, or neither. Let me think through the composition step by step.\n\nLet me denote h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)). So, h(x) is the composition of f(g(x\u00b3)). To determine if h(x) is even, odd, or neither, I should check h(-x).\n\nLet me compute h(-x):\n\nh(-x) = f(g((-x)\u00b3)).\n\nFirst, let's process inner function g. Since -x is raised to the 3rd power, (-x)\u00b3 = -x\u00b3. So, the argument becomes -x\u00b3. Then, since g is odd, g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). So, substituting back into h(-x), we have:\n\nh(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n\nNow, since f is even, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)). Let me note that down.\n\nTherefore, h(-x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = h(x). \n\nWait, so h(-x) = h(x). That means h(x) is even because it satisfies the definition of an even function, right? Because plugging in -x doesn't change the value of h(x).\n\nLet me double-check that step:\n\n1. Start with h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n2. To find if it's even or odd, evaluate h(-x).\n3. Compute g(-x\u00b3). Since g is odd, g(-y) = -g(y). So, let y = x\u00b3, then g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3).\n4. Thus, h(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n5. Since f is even, f(-z) = f(z) for any z. Therefore, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n6. Thus, h(-x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = h(x).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, h(-x) = h(x), which is exactly the condition for h(x) being even. Therefore, f(g(x\u00b3)) is an even function.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any steps or misapply the properties. Hmm.\n\nAnother way to think about it: suppose f(x) is even, so f(-y) = f(y). g is odd, so g(-z) = -g(z). So, plugging into h(-x):\n\nh(-x) = f(g((-x)\u00b3)) = f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-g(x\u00b3)) because g is odd. Then, using f is even, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = h(x). So yes, h(-x) = h(x), so h is even.\n\nAlternatively, I can use substitutions:\n\nLet\u2019s consider substituting x with -x in h(x):\n\nh(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(-x^3)) because (-x)^3 is -x^3.\n\nSince g is odd, g(-x^3) = -g(x^3). Plugging that in, h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)).\n\nBut f is even, so f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)).\n\nBut f(g(x^3)) is exactly h(x). So, h(-x) = h(x), so h is even.\n\nTherefore, regardless of specific functions f and g, as long as f is even and g is odd, the composition f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nLet me test with actual functions to verify.\n\nSuppose f(x) = x\u00b2 (which is even) and g(x) = x\u00b3 (which is odd). Then h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = (x\u00b3)^3 = x^9.\n\nWait, is x^9 even or odd? Well, x^9 is an odd function because (-x)^9 = -x^9. So, wait, h(x) = x^9 is odd, which contradicts our earlier conclusion that it's even.\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem right. Did I make an error somewhere?\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me compute h(x) in this case.\n\nf(x) = x\u00b2, g(x) = x\u00b3.\n\nThen h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = f((x\u00b3)^3) = f(x^9) = (x^9)^2 = x^18.\n\nAh, that's even because (-x)^18 = x^18. So h(-x) = (-x)^18 = x^18 = h(x). So, in this case, h(x) is even.\n\nBut earlier, I thought h(x) = x^9, which is odd, but actually, wait, no:\n\nNo, because in the composition f(g(x\u00b3)), with f(x) = x\u00b2, which is even, and g(x\u00b3) is x^9, which is an odd function. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) is (x^9)\u00b2 = x^{18}. So, yes, it's even.\n\nWait, but if I had g(x) = x\u00b3, f(x) = x, then h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = x\u00b3, which is odd. Hmm, but in that case, f is neither even nor odd necessarily? Wait, no.\n\nWait, is f(x) = x considered even or odd? f(-x) = -x = -f(x), so yes, f(x) = x is odd. So in that example, f is odd, right.\n\nBut in our original problem, f is even. So, in my first example, with f being x\u00b2 and g being x\u00b3: f is even, g is odd. So then, h is f(g(x\u00b3)) is x^18, which is even. So that works.\n\nBut wait, if f is the identity function, which is odd, and g is odd, then f(g(x\u00b3)) would be g(x\u00b3), which, if g is odd, would make it odd cubed, which is also odd. So, we can clearly see that the composition's parity depends on the functions involved.\n\nWait, but in our problem, f is even, g is odd.\n\nWait, let me take another example to check.\n\nSuppose f(x) = x^4, which is even. g(x) = x^5, which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) would be (x^5)^3)^4? Wait, no. Wait, no, wait, g(x\u00b3) is x\u00b3^5? Wait, no: Hold on, no. If g(x) = x^5, then g(x\u00b3) = (x\u00b3)^5 = x^{15}.\n\nThen, f(g(x\u00b3)) = f(x^{15}) = (x^{15})^4 = x^{60}. Which is even, because (-x)^60 = x^60. So yes, h(x) = x^{60} is even.\n\nAlternatively, if I took g(x) = x (odd) and f(x) = x\u00b2 (even). Then f(g(x\u00b3)) is (g(x\u00b3))^2 = (x\u00b3)^2 = x^6, which is even. So that works too.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake before when thinking of f(x) = x being odd, but in the problem, f is specifically even. So, in that case, if I have f(x) = x, which is odd, but in our problem, f is even, so we have to use f preserving the symmetry, making the composition even.\n\nAlternatively, what if f is a constant function? Like f(x) = 2, which is even? Wait, f(-x) = 2 = f(x), so yes, constant function is even. Then g(x) is odd, say g(x) = x\u00b3. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) = f(x^9) = 2, which is even because h(-x) = 2 = h(x). So yeah, that still holds.\n\nOkay, so testing multiple cases, and in all of them, f(g(x\u00b3)) is even when f is even and g is odd. So, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, I think the conclusion is that h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) is even under the given conditions.\n\nWait, but just to ensure, what if f is even, g is odd, but, say, f is even like x\u00b2, and g is odd like x, so f(g(x\u00b3)) = (x\u00b3)^2 = x^6, which is even. Alternatively, if g was an odd function but not x\u00b3, say, sin(x). Then f(g(x\u00b3)) = (sin(x\u00b3))\u00b2, which is still even because [sin(-x\u00b3)]\u00b2 = [ - sin(x\u00b3) ]\u00b2 = [sin(x\u00b3)]\u00b2, which is equal to (sin(x\u00b3))\u00b2. So, yeah, squaring it would make it even regardless. That also makes sense because f is even, so whatever comes out of g is squared.\n\nSo, seems solid.\n\nAnother angle: If f is even, then f(-y) = f(y). So, for h(x), h(-x) = f(g(-x\u00b3)).\n\nSince g is odd, g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3).\n\nTherefore:\n\nh(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n\nBecause f is even, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nWhich is h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nTherefore, h(-x) = h(x), which is the definition of even.\n\nYep, so that's consistent.\n\nSo, mathematically, no mistake in the reasoning.\n\nPerhaps my initial confusion came when choosing a function g for h(x) = g(x\u00b3), but when f is not necessarily even, but f is applied to g(x\u00b3), then the behavior is different. But in our problem, f is even, so f(g(x\u00b3)) ends up being even.\n\nHence, I feel confident the answer is even.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\nFirst, recall the definitions:\n- An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n- An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\nTo determine the nature of \\( f(g(x^3)) \\), we evaluate it at \\( -x \\):\n\n1.

Recognize that \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is the original function \\( h(x) \\):\n   \\[\n   h(-x) = h(x)\n   \\]\n\nThus, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) satisfies the condition for being an even function.

Hmm. Let's see. First, I remember that an even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x, and an odd function satisfies f(-x) = -f(x) for all x.\n\nWait, in this case, f(x) is even and g(x) is odd. So I need to see what happens when I compose these functions with x\u00b3 inside. Let me think step by step.\n\nLet me denote h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)). To determine if h(x) is even, odd, or neither, I should check h(-x) and see how it relates to h(x).\n\nSo, h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)). Let me compute (-x)^3 first. Since (-x)^3 = -x\u00b3, that simplifies to -x\u00b3. So h(-x) becomes f(g(-x\u00b3)).\n\nBut since g is an odd function, g(-y) = -g(y) for any y. Let me let y = x\u00b3, then g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). So substituting back, we have h(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n\nNow, f is an even function, so f(-z) = f(z) for any z. Let me set z = g(x\u00b3), so f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)). Therefore, h(-x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = h(x).\n\nSince h(-x) = h(x), that means h(x) is an even function. So f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nWait, let me go over that again to make sure I didn't skip a step. So f is even, so applying f to something negative is the same as applying f to the positive version. Therefore, h(-x) becomes f of g(-x\u00b3) which is f(g(-x\u00b3)). Since g is odd, g(-x\u00b3) is -g(x\u00b3). So h(-x) becomes f(-g(x\u00b3)). Since f is even, that's the same as f(g(x\u00b3)) which is h(x). So yes, h(-x) = h(x). Therefore, h(x) is even.\n\nHmm, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. Let me double-check with an example maybe? Maybe pick specific f and g functions and test.\n\nSuppose f(x) = x\u00b2, which is even. Let g(x) = x\u00b3 - x, which is an odd function since g(-x) = (-x)^3 - (-x) = -x\u00b3 + x = -(x\u00b3 - x) = -g(x). So f(g(x\u00b3)) would be (g(x\u00b3))\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute g(x\u00b3): g(x\u00b3) = (x\u00b3)^3 - x\u00b3 = x^9 - x\u00b3. Then h(x) = (x^9 - x\u00b3)^2. Let's see what h(-x) is: h(-x) = ((-x)^9 - (-x)^3)^2 = (-x^9 + x^3)^2 = (x^3 - x^9)^2, which is the same as (x^9 - x^3)^2. So h(-x) = h(x). Yep, so that's even.\n\nAnother example: Let\u2019s pick f(x) = cos(x), which is even, and g(x) = sin(x), which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) is cos(sin(x\u00b3)). Now, let's check if this is even. \n\nh(-x) = cos(sin((-x)^3)) = cos(sin(-x\u00b3)) = cos(-sin(x\u00b3)) because sin is odd. But cos is even, so cos(-sin(x\u00b3)) = cos(sin(x\u00b3)) = h(x). So again, h(-x) = h(x). Therefore, even.\n\nWait, what if f is even but g is not necessarily linear? Let's try another one. Let f(x) = e^x + e^{-x}, which is also even. Because f(-x) = e^{-x} + e^{x} = f(x). Let\u2019s let g(x) = x^3, which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) = e^{g(x\u00b3)} + e^{-g(x\u00b3)} = e^{x^9} + e^{-x^9}. Now test h(-x). h(-x) = e^{(-x)^9} + e^{-(-x)^9} = e^{-x^9} + e^{x^9}, which is the same as h(x). So still even.\n\nWait, let me try with an f that's even, and g that's odd but not linear. Let\u2019s take f(x) = |x|, since it's even. Let g(x) be any odd function, say, g(x) = x^5 - x, which is odd.\n\nThen f(g(x\u00b3)) is |g(x\u00b3)| = |x^15 - x\u00b3|. Now, let's find h(-x) = |g((-x)^3)| = |g(-x\u00b3)| = | -g(x\u00b3) | = | - (x^15 - x\u00b3) | = |x^15 - x\u00b3| because absolute value of negative is positive. So again, h(-x) = h(x). Even.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Let me think if there's a case where it's not even.\n\nWait, suppose f is even, say f(x) = x^4 which is even, and g(x) = x^3 - x^5, which is still odd. Hmm, then g(x\u00b3) is (x\u00b3)^3 - (x\u00b3)^5 = x^9 - x^{15}, so h(x) = (x^9 - x^{15})^4. Then h(-x) = ((-x)^9 - (-x)^{15})^4. But since -x^9 = -x^9 and -x^{15} = -x^{15}. So (-x^9 - (-x^{15})) = -x^9 + x^{15}. Then h(-x) is (-x^9 + x^{15})^4.\n\nBut (-x^9 + x^{15}) is equal to -(x^9 - x^{15}), and raising it to the 4th power: (-1)^4*(x^9 - x^{15})^4 = (x^9 - x^{15})^4, same as h(x). So h(-x)=h(x). Thus even.\n\nAnother scenario: suppose f is even, g is odd, so f(g(x\u00b3)). So plugging in -x into x\u00b3 gives -x\u00b3, which, because g is odd, gives -g(x\u00b3). And since f is even, f(-g(x\u00b3))=f(g(x\u00b3))=h(x). So algebraically, yes, it's even. \n\nWait, is there any case where this wouldn't hold? Maybe if the functions are more complicated? Suppose f is even, g is odd, and f(g(x\u00b3)) is a constant function, which is also even or odd? Wait, let's say f is the constant function. Suppose f(x)=1, which is even. Let g(x)=x, which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3))=1, which is even. So in that case, it's even. Alternatively, f(x)=0 is even, g(x)=0, which is even\u2014wait, is zero function considered both even and odd? Wait, actually, the zero function is both even and odd since f(-x)=f(x) and f(-x)=-f(x). So in that trivial case, it's both.\n\nBut regardless, if h(x) is both even and odd, it's actually the zero function. But in the above problem, f is even, g is odd, so f(g(x\u00b3)) would have to be... Wait, except for the zero function, other cases?\n\nWait, if g(x\u00b3) is such that g(x\u00b3) is a constant function? Hmm, like if g(x) is a constant. Let me say g(x)=k, which is a constant. Then since g is a constant, which is also even because g(-x)=k=-k? No, wait, g(x)=k implies that it's even if k= -k, which implies k=0. So if g is a constant function, it's a constant zero function, because otherwise, if it's a non-zero constant, g(-x)=g(x) as it's a constant, but for oddity, g(-x)=-g(x), which would require k = -k, meaning k must be zero.\n\nSo in that case, if g was a constant non-zero, it can't be odd. So g must be zero function. Then f(g(x\u00b3))=f(0). If f is even, f(0) is a constant. So the result is a constant, which as I said, is both even and odd.\n\nBut in that case, is that different from just being even? Well, if it is a constant function, it's both. So, in terms of whether it's considered even or just even? Since only even and odd functions are usually defined up to sign, but as per problem statement, we can say it's even because it satisfies the condition without violating being odd. Wait, but if a function is both even and odd, it's the zero function. So if f(x)=0, then h(x)=0 is both, but in this case, if g(x)=0, then h(x)=f(0), which is a constant. So if f(0) is non-zero, h(x)=c, which is both even and odd only if c=0.\n\nBut in any case, regardless of that specific case, since in the earlier steps we showed that h(-x)=h(x), which is sufficient for being even. It might also be odd if h(x)=0, but in that case, only the zero function is both. Otherwise, h(x) would just be even.\n\nSo, when dealing with h(x)=f(g(x\u00b3)), since g is odd, the composition flips the sign, but f, being even, negates it back, leading h(x) to be even. Alternatively, all the steps algebraically lead to h(-x)=h(x). So I think it's safe to conclude that f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nI think my thought process is solid here. So, the answer must be even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nTo determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither, we start by noting that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function. \n\nA function \\( h(x) \\) is even if \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\) for all \\( x \\), and it is odd if \\( h(-x) = -h(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\nLet \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).

It tells me that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function. Hmm, okay, let me recall some properties of even and odd functions.\n\nAn even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\), right? So, if I plug in \\(-x\\), it's the same as plugging in \\( x \\). Classic examples are like \\( x^2 \\) or cosine functions. On the other hand, an odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). These functions are symmetric about the origin. Examples include \\( x^3 \\) or sine functions.\n\nSo, the problem is about composing functions here: \\( f(g(x^3)) \\). Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that \\( x^3 \\) is an odd function because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\). So, \\( g(x^3) \\) would be \\( g(\\text{something odd}) \\). But wait, \\( g \\) is an odd function, so does that mean \\( g(x^3) \\) is odd?\n\nLet me test it: if I plug in \\(-x\\) into \\( g(x^3) \\), it becomes \\( g((-x)^3) = g(-x^3) \\). Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, \\( g(x^3) \\) is indeed an odd function because \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).\n\nSo, now we have \\( g(x^3) \\) as an odd function. The next step is applying \\( f \\) to it. \\( f \\) is even, so \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). Let me set \\( y = g(x^3) \\). Then, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\) because \\( f \\) is even.\n\nNow, to check if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even or odd, I need to evaluate it at \\( -x \\) and see what happens. Let's compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\).\n\nFirst, \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\), so inside the function, we have \\( g(-x^3) \\). But as established earlier, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n\nSince \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). So, replacing \\( x \\) with \\( -x \\) in \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) doesn't change the value; that is, \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). \n\nBy the definition of even functions, if \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), then \\( h(x) \\) is even. So here, \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\), and plugging in \\( -x \\) doesn't change the value. That suggests that \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is indeed an even function.\n\nWait, let me make sure there are no mistakes here. What if the composition is more complex? Hmm, let's try a concrete example.\n\nSuppose \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\), which is odd. Then, \\( f(g(x^3)) = (x^3)^2 = x^6 \\). Now, is \\( x^6 \\) even? Yes, because \\( (-x)^6 = x^6 \\). That works.\n\nLet me try another example. Let \\( f(x) = \\cos(x) \\), which is even, and \\( g(x) = \\sin(x) \\), which is odd. Then, \\( g(x^3) = \\sin(x^3) \\). Applying \\( f \\), we get \\( \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\). Hmmm, is this function even or odd?\n\nLet's test \\( \\cos(\\sin((-x)^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(-x^3)) \\). Since sine is odd, \\( \\sin(-x^3) = -\\sin(x^3) \\), so \\( \\cos(-\\sin(x^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\) because cosine is even. So, indeed, the composition remains the same when replacing \\( x \\) with \\( -x \\), which means it's even. That seems to back up my earlier conclusion.\n\nIs there a case where it might not be even? Suppose \\( f \\) is a constant function, which is trivially even. Then \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is just a constant, which is even. If \\( f \\) is something else, like \\( f(x) = |x| \\), which is also even, then composing with any odd function inside would still give an even function because \\( |g(x^3)| \\) is the same as \\( |g(-x^3)| \\) since both \\( x^3 \\) and \\( -x^3 \\) are mapped to their absolute values by \\( f \\).\n\nSo, it seems consistent. Each example I test is confirming that the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even when \\( f \\) is even and \\( g \\) is odd. I don't see a scenario where it could be odd. Since both functions have specific symmetries, the result inherits the symmetry from \\( f \\).\n\nWait, but why does it not become odd? Suppose \\( f \\) was odd instead, but in our case, it's even. So, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is made by an even function composed with an odd function inside another odd function. That seems like it would preserve some symmetry but not necessarily switch it.\n\nWait, perhaps another angle: if \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\), and then \\( f(g(-x)) = f(-g(x)) \\). But since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x)) = f(g(x)) \\). So, \\( f(g(-x)) = f(g(x)) \\), which means \\( f(g(x)) \\) is even.\n\nTherefore, in our case, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even because \\( f(g(-x^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nYes, that seems to solidify the conclusion. So, applying \\( f \\) after an odd function preserves the evenness because of how even functions treat negatives inside.\n\nSo, to recap, since \\( g(x^3) \\) is odd, when you apply an even function \\( f \\) to it, the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) becomes even. Therefore, the answer should be that \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is an even function.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1. An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n2. An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n3. The function \\( x^3 \\) is an odd function because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\).\n\nFirst, we evaluate \\( g(x^3) \\):\n- Since \\( g \\) is an odd function, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore, \\( g(x^3) \\) is an odd function.\n\nNext, we apply the even function \\( f \\) to \\( g(x^3) \\):\n- Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-y) = f(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). Let \\( y = g(x^3) \\). Then, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nTo check if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, we evaluate it at \\( -x \\):\n- \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n- Since \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\), we have \\( f(-g(x^3)) \\).\n- Because \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nThus, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even because it satisfies the condition \\( f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nThe function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>",
        "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c><\uff5cUser\uff5c>Please solve the following mathematical problem, placing your final answer within \\boxed{}:\nIf $f(x)$ is an even function and $g(x)$ is an odd function, find if $f(g(x^3))$ is even, odd, or neither.\n\nEnter \"odd\", \"even\", or \"neither\".<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, we have two functions here: f(x) is even, and g(x) is odd. The question is asking about the nature of another function, f(g(x\u00b3)). Is it even, odd, or neither?\n\nOkay, let me recall my function properties. Even functions satisfy the condition f(-x) = f(x), right? So, for example, f(x) = x\u00b2 is even because (-x)\u00b2 = x\u00b2. On the other hand, odd functions satisfy g(-x) = -g(x), like g(x) = x\u00b3 because (-x)\u00b3 = -x\u00b3.\n\nSo, we're dealing with f(g(x\u00b3)). Let me break this down step by step. First, I can think of the operations as a composition of functions. So, starting from the innermost function, we have x\u00b3, then we apply g to that, and finally f to the result.\n\nGiven that, let's try to test whether f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, odd, or neither. The standard method is to compute f(g((-x)\u00b3)) and see how it relates to f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n1. Compute (-x)\u00b3: that's -x\u00b3. Okay, that negative sign is important.\n2. Then apply g to that result: g(-x\u00b3). But since g is an odd function, g(-a) = -g(a) for any a. So, g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3).\n3. Now, we plug that into f: f(-g(x\u00b3)). So, we have f(-g(x\u00b3)).\n\nBut wait, f is an even function. Even functions satisfy f(-y) = f(y) for any y. So, if we let y = g(x\u00b3), then f(-y) = f(y). Therefore, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nPutting it all together: f(g((-x)\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)). \n\nThis means that when we substitute -x into the function f(g(x\u00b3)), we just get the same value as f(g(x\u00b3)). Which by definition of even functions is exactly what even means.\n\nSo, it seems that f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nBut hold on, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It often helps to test with specific examples for f and g that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nLet's choose f(x) as an even function. The simplest example is f(x) = x\u00b2.\n\nLet's pick g(x) as an odd function. Again, the simplest example is g(x) = x\u00b3.\n\nNow, let's compute f(g(x\u00b3)). Let's see:\n\n- First, compute x\u00b3. Then, apply g to that: g(x\u00b3) = (x\u00b3)\u00b3 = x\u2079.\n- Then, apply f to x\u2079: f(x\u2079) = (x\u2079)\u00b2 = x\u00b9\u2078.\n\nSo, f(g(x\u00b3)) = x\u00b9\u2078.\n\nNow, is x\u00b9\u2078 an even function? Well, yes, because if we replace x with -x, we have (-x)\u00b9\u2078 = x\u00b9\u2078, which is the same as the original function.\n\nSo, in this specific example, f(g(x\u00b3)) is indeed an even function.\n\nLet me try another example to make sure my reasoning isn't flawed.\n\nLet me choose a different even function, say f(x) = cos(x), which is even since cos(-x) = cos(x).\n\nAnd another odd function, say g(x) = x.\n\nSo, f(g(x\u00b3)) becomes f(x\u00b3) = cos(x\u00b3).\n\nIs cos(x\u00b3) even? Yes, because cos(-x\u00b3)=cos(x\u00b3). So, it maintains the evenness.\n\nAnother example: f(x) = |x|, which is even, and g(x) = sin(x), which is odd.\n\nThen, f(g(x\u00b3)) = |g(x\u00b3)| = |sin(x\u00b3)|. Is this even? Let's see: |sin(-x\u00b3)| = | - sin(x\u00b3) | = |sin(x\u00b3)|, so yes, it is even.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Maybe I should try a non-monotonic example.\n\nLet\u2019s take f(x) = x\u00b2 + 1, which is still even, and g(x) = x\u00b3 - x, which is odd because g(-x) = (-x)\u00b3 - (-x) = -x\u00b3 + x = - (x\u00b3 - x) = -g(x).\n\nThen, f(g(x\u00b3)) would be [g(x\u00b3)]\u00b2 + 1 = [ (x\u00b3)\u00b3 - (x\u00b3) ]\u00b2 + 1 = (x\u2079 - x\u00b3)\u00b2 + 1.\n\nExpanding this, we get (x\u00b9\u2078 - 2x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u2076) + 1. Is this even? Yes, since all the exponents are even numbers. So replacing x with -x would yield the same result: [ (-x)\u2079 - (-x)\u00b3 ]\u00b2 + 1 = (-x\u2079 + x\u00b3)\u00b2 + 1 = (x\u2079 - x\u00b3)\u00b2 + 1, which is the same as the original.\n\nSo, again, it's even. Hmm, interesting. Maybe this is a consistent result.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me try a function where perhaps f(g(x\u00b3)) could have different behavior.\n\nSuppose f(x) is even, but not as straightforward, like f(x) = e^(-x\u00b2), which is even since it's symmetric around the y-axis. And then g(x) is odd, say g(x) = x. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) = e^(-x\u2076). Which is still even because exponentials of even powers remain even.\n\nHold on, let me see if I can manage a contrived example where f(g(x\u00b3)) isn't even. Maybe f(x) is even, but somehow g doesn't preserve the signature. But given that g is odd, g(-x) = -g(x), which would inherently create symmetry that when squared or composed within f, which is even, might nullify any asymmetry.\n\nThinking in terms of composition, if you have an even function applied on an odd function, then inside you have an odd function, then applied to an even function, overall what is the result? Wait, perhaps we can think about it as f(g(x)).\n\nBut in our case, it's f(g(x\u00b3)). So, perhaps let\u2019s dissect that:\n\nFirst, x\u00b3 is an odd function, because if you flip x to -x, it becomes -x\u00b3. Then, applying g, which is itself an odd function, so g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). Then, applying f, which is even, so f(-g(x\u00b3))=f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nSo, in other words, f(g(-x\u00b3))=f(g(x\u00b3)) which is exactly the condition for f(g(x\u00b3)) being even.\n\nTherefore, it does hold.\n\nThus, yes, f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nI think that seems consistent across multiple examples. So, I can conclude that f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1. **Understanding the properties**:\n   - An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\).\n   - An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\n2. **Testing the composition**:\n   - Compute \\( f(g((-x)^3)) \\).\n   - Simplify \\( (-x)^3 \\) to \\( -x^3 \\).\n   - Apply \\( g \\) to \\( -x^3 \\).

Let me recall some definitions first. An even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain, and an odd function satisfies f(-x) = -f(x) for all x. \n\nGiven that f(x) is even, so f(-y) = f(y) for any y. And g(x) is odd, so g(-y) = -g(y). Now, I need to determine the nature of the composite function f(g(x^3)). \n\nFirst, maybe I should express f(g(x^3)) in terms of x and then evaluate it at -x to see how it behaves. Let me denote h(x) = f(g(x^3)), so h(-x) will be f(g((-x)^3)). Hmm, since (-x)^3 is equal to -x^3, this simplifies to h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)). \n\nBut wait, g is an odd function, so g(-y) = -g(y). Let me substitute y with x^3 in this equation, so g(-x^3) = -g(x^3). Therefore, h(-x) becomes f(-g(x^3)). \n\nNow, f is an even function, so f(-z) = f(z) for any z. Let me let z = g(x^3), so f(-g(x^3)) becomes f(g(x^3)). Therefore, h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) which is exactly h(x). \n\nSo that means h(-x) = h(x), which is the definition of an even function. So, f(g(x^3)) is an even function. Let me just go through that step by step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n1. Start with h(x) = f(g(x^3)).\n2. Compute h(-x): f(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(-x^3)).\n3. Since g is odd, g(-x^3) = -g(x^3).\n4. So, h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)).\n5. Since f is even, f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)).\n6. And that is h(x).\n7. Hence, h(-x) = h(x), so h(x) is even.\n\nYeah, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in that reasoning. So, f(g(x^3)) should be even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine whether the function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\n1. Start with the function \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n2. Evaluate \\( h(-x) \\): \n   \\[\n   h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3))\n   \\]\n3. Simplify the argument inside \\( g \\):\n   \\[\n   (-x)^3 = -x^3\n   \\]\n   Thus,\n   \\[\n   h(-x) = f(g(-x^3))\n   \\]\n4. Since \\( g(x) \\) is odd, we have \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). Therefore,\n   \\[\n   h(-x) = f(-g(x^3))\n   \\]\n5. Since \\( f(x) \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). Hence,\n   \\[\n   h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x)\n   \\]\n6. This shows that \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), which means \\( h(x) \\) is an even function.\n\nThus, the function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>",

They told me that f(x) is even and g(x) is odd. Hmm, okay, let me recall what even and odd functions are.\n\nAn even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain. So, if I plug in -x, I get the same result as when I plug in x. Classic examples are functions like x\u00b2 or cos(x).\n\nAn odd function, on the other hand, satisfies g(-x) = -g(x). So, flipping the sign of x flips the sign of the output. Examples are x\u00b3, sin(x), etc.\n\nAlright, so we have to figure out the nature of f(g(x\u00b3)). Let\u2019s break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe I should figure out what happens when I plug in -x into f(g(x\u00b3)). If f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, then f(g(-x\u00b3)) should equal f(g(x\u00b3)). If it's odd, then f(g(-x\u00b3)) should equal -f(g(x\u00b3)). Otherwise, it would be neither.\n\nSo, let's compute f(g(-x\u00b3)).\n\nSince g is an odd function, g(-x\u00b3) should be equal to -g(x\u00b3). Okay, so:\n\nf(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-g(x\u00b3))\n\nNow, f is an even function, so f(-y) = f(y) for any y. Therefore, replacing y with g(x\u00b3):\n\nf(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3))\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nf(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3))\n\nWhich means f(g(x\u00b3)) satisfies f(-x) = f(x), right? Because replacing x with -x gives the same value.\n\nWait a second, does that make f(g(x\u00b3)) an even function?\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn\u2019t skip a step.\n\nWe had f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-g(x\u00b3)). Since f is even, -g(x\u00b3) inside f is the same as g(x\u00b3), so f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nTherefore, f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)), meaning f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nWait, is there another perspective? Maybe thinking about the composition of functions and their symmetries.\n\nLet me consider the composition f(g(x\u00b3)). The inside function is x\u00b3, which is odd because (-x)\u00b3 = -x\u00b3. So, the inside function is odd.\n\nThen, the outside function is f, which is even. So, f of an odd function? But how does that affect the composition?\n\nIf I recall, composing an even function around an odd function, what does that do? Hmm. Let me think about transformations.\n\nIf you have an even function, say f, and you plug another function h(x) into it. Then, f(h(-x)) = f(-h(x)) because h is odd. But since f is even, f(-h(x)) = f(h(x)). So, f(h(-x)) = f(h(x)).\n\nWhich means f(h(x)) is even.\n\nIn our problem, h(x) is x\u00b3, which is odd. Therefore, f(g(x\u00b3)) as a composition of an even function f around an odd function g(x\u00b3) is even.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, is x\u00b3 an odd function? Yes, because (-x)^3 = -x\u00b3.\n\nThen, g being odd, so plugging that in, I have g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). Then, plugging that into f, which is even, so f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nThat gives us f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)), so f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nLet me try testing it with specific functions to see if this makes sense.\n\nSuppose g(x) = x, which is definitely odd, and f(x) = x\u00b2, which is even. So, f(g(x\u00b3)) = (x\u00b3)\u00b2 = x^6. Is x^6 even? Yes, because (-x)^6 = x^6.\n\nAnother example: Let g(x) = x\u00b3 (which is odd), and f(x) = x^4 (even). Then, f(g(x)) = (x\u00b3)^4 = x^{12}, which is even.\n\nWait, maybe an example where g(x) is some other odd function, like g(x) = sin(x). Let f(x) = x\u00b2 (even). Then, f(g(x^3)) = (sin(x\u00b3))^2. Is that even?\n\nYes, because (sin((-x)^3))^2 = (sin(-x\u00b3))^2 = (-sin(x\u00b3))^2 = (sin(x\u00b3))^2. So, it's even.\n\nAnother test case: let g(x) = -x, which is odd, because g(-x) = -(-x) = x = -g(x). Wait, really? No, actually, g(-x) = -(-x) = x = -g(x) if g(x) = -x. Wait, plugging in x, g(x) = -x, so g(-x) = -(-x) = x, which is -g(x). So, it is odd. So, putting into f(x) = x^3, which is odd, but f needs to be even. So, f(g(x^3)) = (g(x^3))^3 = ( -x^9 )^3 = -x^{27}, which is odd. Wait, hold on, but f is supposed to be even. Wait, let me redo that.\n\nHold on, if f is even, so f(x) = |x| for example. Then, f(g(x\u00b3)) = |g(x\u00b3)|. Since g is odd, g(x\u00b3) is odd, so |g(x\u00b3)| is even, right? Because absolute value makes all negatives positive.\n\nWait, actually, if g(x) is odd, then g(x^3) is odd because x\u00b3 is odd so composing it with g (odd) gives odd, as substitution. So |g(x\u00b3)| is even because the absolute value wraps it, so flipping the sign doesn't matter. Therefore, even.\n\nBut maybe if f is x^2, which is even, f(g(x\u00b3)) = [g(x\u00b3)]\u00b2, which is [(-x\u00b3)]\u00b2 = x^6, which is even.\n\nWait, but if f is an even function and g is odd, f(g(x\u00b3)) is going to be f of something that is odd, but f is even, so f(-y) = f(y). Therefore, f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nWait, yeah, as in the first step. So, f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nThese test cases are showing it's even, so my conclusion seems right.\n\nWait, let me see one more test case where f and g might be more complicated. Suppose f(x) = |x| + x\u00b2, which is even, and g(x) = x, which is odd. Then, f(g(x\u00b3)) = |x\u00b3| + (x\u00b3)\u00b2 = |x\u00b3| + x^6, which is even because absolute value is even and x^6 is even. So, sum is even.\n\nAnother example: f(x) = e^{x} + e^{-x}, which is even, since substituting -x gives e^{-x} + e^{x} which is the same. If g(x) is any odd function, say, g(x) = x. Then, f(g(x\u00b3)) = e^{x\u00b3} + e^{-x\u00b3}, which is even.\n\nWait, is that even? Because if I put -x, I get e^{-x\u00b3} + e^{x\u00b3}, which is the same as before. So yes, even yes.\n\nWait, another odd function for g: g(x) = x^3, so that's an odd function, plug into an even f(x). If f(x) = x^4, then f(g(x\u00b3)) is (x^3)^4 = x^{12}, which is even. If f(x) is |x|, then f(g(x\u00b3)) = |x^3| = |x| x^2, which is even.\n\nSo, all my test cases are giving me that f(g(x\u00b3)) is even. Therefore, I think it's safe to conclude it's even.\n\nWait, what would happen if g were even? Then, g(-x) = g(x), so f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)), and if f is even as well, then f(g(x\u00b3)) would still be even. But in this case, g is odd, so that composition flips to f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)), so the same function.\n\nSo, yeah, seems that as long as f is even and g is odd, then f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to think in terms of composition properties. So, f(g(x\u00b3)) is a composition where the innermost function is x\u00b3 which is odd, composing with g, which is odd, so the result is still odd if you consider g(x\u00b3). Then, f is even, so function f applied to an odd function.\n\nBut when you apply an even function on an odd function, do you get even or odd? So, if h(x) is odd, then f(h(x)) where f is even. Then, f(h(-x)) = f(-h(x)) = f(h(x)). So, f(h(-x)) = f(h(x)), which means f(h(x)) is even.\n\nHence f(g(x\u00b3)) is even.\n\nSo, that seems to fit.\n\nAlternatively, because x\u00b3 is odd, the composition inside is g(x\u00b3), which is odd, then f is even, so the outer function is even, so when you apply it to an odd function, you get an even function.\n\nHence, all of these lines of thought lead me to the conclusion that it's even. Therefore, the answer should be even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nTo determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither, we start by recalling the properties of even and odd functions.

I need to determine whether the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\nFirst, let me recall some definitions. An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in its domain. On the other hand, an odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). Now, I need to analyze the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nLet me break it down step by step. The composition involves three functions: first, \\( x^3 \\), then \\( g \\), and finally \\( f \\). So, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is a composition of these three functions.\n\nSince \\( x^3 \\) is a function, let's think about whether it's even or odd. Remember, \\( (x)^3 \\) is an odd function because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\). So, the innermost function \\( x^3 \\) is odd.\n\nNext, \\( g(x) \\) is given as an odd function, so if I apply \\( g \\) to \\( x^3 \\), which is odd, how does that affect the result? Let me compute \\( g(x^3) \\). If \\( g \\) is odd, then \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). But since we're dealing with \\( g \\) applied to \\( x^3 \\), maybe it's helpful to consider substituting \\( -x \\) into \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) and see what happens.\n\nSo, let's define \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\). To check if \\( h(x) \\) is even or odd, I'll compute \\( h(-x) \\) and compare it to \\( h(x) \\) and \\( -h(x) \\).\n\nComputing \\( h(-x) \\):\n\n\\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\)  \nSimplify \\( (-x)^3 \\).  \n\\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\), so  \n\\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\).\n\nNow, since \\( g \\) is an odd function, \\( g(-y) = -g(y) \\) for any y. Let me set \\( y = x^3 \\), so:\n\n\\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).  \nTherefore,  \n\\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\).  \nBut \\( f \\) is an even function. Applying an even function to \\( -g(x^3) \\) gives:  \n\\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\), because \\( f(-a) = f(a) \\) when \\( f \\) is even.\n\nSo, \\( h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( h(x) \\) satisfies the condition for being an even function: \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\). Hence, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\nWait, let me go through that again to make sure I haven't missed anything. Starting with \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\). \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\) because \\( g \\) is odd. Then, passing this through \\( f \\), which is even, so \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). That brings us back to \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so yes, it's definitely even.\n\nIs there a possibility that this could be neither? Hmm, not unless maybe the composition somehow disrupts the evenness or oddness in a non-uniform way, but in this case, each step follows from the properties of even and odd functions.\n\nWait, let me think about function composition in general. So, if I have f(g(x)), where f is even and g is odd, does it always result in an even function?\n\nLet me test with concrete functions. Let me choose f(x) = x\u00b2 (which is even) and g(x) = x\u00b3 (which is odd). Then, f(g(x)) = (x\u00b3)\u00b2 = x\u2076, which is even, because substituting -x gives (-x)^6 = x^6, same as f(g(x)). So that's consistent.\n\nAnother example: Let f(x) = cos(x) which is even, and g(x) = sin(x) which is odd. Then f(g(x)) = cos(sin(x)). Now, is this even? Let's test for x:\n\nf(g(-x)) = cos(sin(-x)) = cos(-sin(x)) = cos(sin(x)) because cosine is even. Therefore, f(g(-x)) = f(g(x)), so it is even. Therefore, this composition is also even.\n\nConversely, if I have f(x) even and g(x) odd, another thought: What if f is a reflection or something else? Wait, f and g are arbitrary functions with those parity properties. So as long as f is even, applying f to an odd function in this way gives an even result.\n\nWait a sec, but in the composition, do we ensure anything about the function's expression? For instance, is it always that way regardless of what f and g are, as long as f is even and g is odd?\n\nLet me see. Suppose f is another even function, say f(x) = x^4, and g(x) = x^3. Then, f(g(x)) = (x^3)^4 = x^{12}, which is even. So it still holds. What if I choose f(x) = |x|, which is even, and g(x) = x^3, which is odd? Then f(g(x)) is |x^3|, which is even as | -x^3 | = |x^3|. So yes.\n\nWhat if g(x) is a more complicated odd function? For example, \\( g(x) = x - x^3 \\). Wait, is that odd? Let's check: g(-x) = (-x) - (-x)^3 = -x - (-x^3) = -x + x^3. Which is not equal to -g(x), because -g(x) = -x + x^3. So in that case, g(x) would satisfy g(-x) = -g(x), meaning it is still odd.\n\nThen, \\( f(g(x)) = (x - x^3)^2 \\), which is even, because squared removes any negative signs.\n\nAlternatively, let me try another approach without plugging in specific functions. Let's compose f and g symbolically.\n\nSince \\( f(x) \\) is even, we know \\( f(-a) = f(a) \\) for any \\( a \\). Let \\( a = g(x^3) \\), then \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\). Now, \\( g \\) is odd, so \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\). So if I consider \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) = f(-g(x^3)) \\), but as \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\). So \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so \\( h(x) \\) is even.\n\nThus, in every case, regardless of what f and g are (as long as f is even and g is odd), the composition \\( f \\circ g \\circ (-x^3) \\) will result in an even function.\n\nWait a moment, what if I made a mistake in how the functions compose? Hmm, the composition is \\( f(g(x^3)) \\), so x is cubed first, then g is applied, then f is applied. So \\( x^3 \\) is in the inner argument of g, which is odd, and then f is an even function on that result.\n\nHmm, another thing, let's suppose \\( f \\) is a non-trivial even function and \\( g \\) is a non-trivial odd function. Is their composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) necessarily even? Since the composition only involves substituting \\( -x \\) into \\( g(x^3) \\), which, since \\( g \\) is odd, negates the whole expression, but then \\( f \\) is even, so it doesn't negate anything.\n\nSo seems like no matter what, substituting \\( -x \\) in the outermost function doesn't change the result because \\( f \\) is even, negating the entire inner function, but after \\( g \\) is already odd.\n\nTherefore, \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\nBut wait, just to test an example where perhaps the composition would not be even? Is that possible?\n\nWait, if we mess with the order, for example, suppose \\( f(g x) \\) then cube it, but in our case, it's \\( f(g(x^3)) \\), so the structure is fixed. Maybe if the functions were inside differently, but here it's as above.\n\nAlternatively, taking \\( x \\rightarrow -x \\):\n\nf(g((-x)^3)) = f(g(-x^3)) because \\( (-x)^3 = -x^3 \\).  \nThen, since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\).  \nThus, \\( f(-g(x^3)) \\).  \nBut \\( f \\) is even, so \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nSo again, we get \\( h(-x) = h(x) \\), so h is even.\n\nTherefore, in the given composition order, f(g(x^3)), where f is even, g is odd, \\( x^3 \\) is odd.\n\nTherefore, it's even.\n\nWait, so it can't be neither because it is equal to h(-x) = h(x). So that suggests it is even.\n\nBut maybe we can think if there is a case when it could be neither.\n\nIs there an instance where substituting the negative variable leads to something different that's not h(x) but not equal to h(-x)?\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nDefine a specific even f and odd g and see.\n\nLet f(x) = x^4 (even), g(x) = x^5 (odd), so f(g(x^3)) = (x^3)^5)^4?

So if \\( g(x) = x^5 \\), then \\( g(x^3) = (x^3)^5 = x^{15} \\), so \\( f(g(x^3)) = (x^{15})^4 = x^{60} \\). Then, since that's even because x^{60} is even, same as x^{60} is (-x)^{60} = x^{60}.\n\nWait, so that's an example of an even function.\n\nAnother example, let\u2019s take f(x) = cos(x), which is even, and g(x) = sin(x), which is odd. Then \\( f(g(x^3)) = \\cos(\\sin(x^3)) \\). Wait, sin is odd, so sin(x^3) is odd because it's composed with x^3 which is odd (and sin is odd: sin(-y) = -sin(y)). So sin(x^3) is odd.\n\nThen, cos is even, so cos(-y) = cos(y). So cos(sin(x^3)) = cos(-sin(x)) = cos(sin(x)). So this is equality, hence, h(-x) = h(x), so it is even.\n\nWait, but actually \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is a function whose evenness we've established, so in all cases, function h(x) satisfies h(-x) = h(x). So, h is even.\n\nTherefore, despite the compositions, h is even.\n\nSo, in all steps, the result becomes even.\n\nConclusion: \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\boxed{even}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine whether the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\nFirst, recall the definitions:\n- An even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\).\n- An odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\nWe need to analyze the composition \\( f(g(x^3)) \\).

I need to figure out whether f(g(x\u00b3)) is even, odd, or neither. Hmm, let's start by recalling what it means for a function to be even or odd.\n\nAn even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain. On the other hand, an odd function satisfies g(-x) = -g(x) for all x in its domain. So, f(x) is even, meaning if I plug in -x, it's the same as plugging in x. And g(x) is odd, meaning plugging in -x flips the sign of the function.\n\nI need to analyze the function h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)). Let's see, I should check if h(-x) equals h(x) or -h(x) or neither. That will tell me if h(x) is even, odd, or neither.\n\nStarting with h(-x), which is f(g((-x)\u00b3)). Let me compute the inside first: (-x)\u00b3. Since any odd power preserves the sign, (-x)\u00b3 = -x\u00b3. So, h(-x) becomes f(g(-x\u00b3)).\n\nNow, since g is an odd function, g(-x\u00b3) = -g(x\u00b3). So, substituting that back, h(-x) = f(-g(x\u00b3)). \n\nNow, looking at f(-g(x\u00b3)). Since f is even, f(-t) = f(t) for any t. Let's set t = g(x\u00b3). So, f(-g(x\u00b3)) = f(g(x\u00b3)). Therefore, h(-x) = f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nBut wait, f(g(x\u00b3)) is exactly h(x). So, h(-x) = h(x). That means h(x) is even. \n\nLet me recap to make sure. Starting with h(-x), substitute in, use the properties of f and g. Since g is odd, (-x)^3 is -x\u00b3, and then since f is even, f of negative something is just f of that something. So, h(-x) equals h(x), hence h is even. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in that reasoning. The key steps were recognizing that x\u00b3 is odd, so (-x)\u00b3 is -x\u00b3, then using the oddness of g to bring out the negative, and then the evenness of f to remove the negative. It all works out that h(-x) equals h(x).\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider specific examples to see if it makes sense. Suppose g(x) is something simple, like g(x) = x, which is odd. Then g(x\u00b3) = x\u00b3. So then f(g(x\u00b3)) = f(x\u00b3). Now, f is even, so f(-x\u00b3) = f(x\u00b3). Therefore, f(g(-x\u00b3)) = f(-x\u00b3) = f(x\u00b3) = f(g(x\u00b3)), which shows that h(-x) = h(x), confirming that h is even.\n\nAlternatively, take g(x) = x\u00b3, which is also odd. Then, g(x\u00b3) = x\u2079, which is also odd. Then, h(x) = f(g(x\u00b3)) = f(x\u2079). Since f is even, plugging in x\u2079 or -x\u2079 doesn't change the value; f(x\u2079) = f(-x\u2079). Therefore, h(-x\u00b3) = f(-x\u2079) = f(x\u2079) = h(x\u00b3), so again h is even. \n\nWait, actually, no\u2014hold on, in this case, since h(-x) is f(g((-x)^3)) = f((-x)^3 * something). Wait, maybe examples can be tricky because the function might behave differently. Let me think of another example.\n\nSay f(x) is x\u00b2, which is even. Let g(x) be x\u00b3, which is odd. Then f(g(x\u00b3)) would be (x\u00b3)\u00b2 = x\u2076, which is even. Because f(g(-x\u00b3)) = (-x\u00b3)\u00b2 = x\u2076, which is same as f(g(x\u00b3)).\n\nAnother example, f(x) = |x|, which is even. Take g(x) = x - x\u00b3, which is odd since -g(x) = -(x - x\u00b3) = -x + x\u00b3 = - (x - x\u00b3) = g(-x). So f(g(x\u00b3)) = |x\u00b3 - (x\u00b3)\u00b3| = |x\u00b3 - x\u2079|. Now, f(g(-x\u00b3)) = |(-x\u00b3) - (-x\u00b3)^3| = | -x\u00b3 - (-x\u2079)| = | -x\u00b3 + x\u2079 | = |x\u2079 -x\u00b3|. Since absolute value doesn't care about the sign, this is the same as |x\u00b3 - x\u2079| which is equal to f(g(x\u00b3)). So, h(-x\u00b3) = h(x\u00b3), meaning h is even.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So the conclusion is that in these cases, it seems to hold. So, probably the answer is even.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{even}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(x) \\) is an even function and \\( g(x) \\) is an odd function, we need to determine if \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is even, odd, or neither.\n\nAn even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) and an odd function satisfies \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\).\n\nLet \\( h(x) = f(g(x^3)) \\).\n\nTo determine if \\( h(x) \\) is even or odd, we evaluate \\( h(-x) \\):\n- \\( h(-x) = f(g((-x)^3)) \\)\n- Since \\((-x)^3 = -x^3\\), we have \\( h(-x) = f(g(-x^3)) \\)\n- Because \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-x^3) = -g(x^3) \\), so \\( h(-x) = f(-g(x^3)) \\)\n- Since \\( f \\) is even, \\( f(-g(x^3)) = f(g(x^3)) \\)\n\nThus, \\( h(-x) = f(g(x^3)) = h(x) \\), which means \\( h(x) \\) is even.\n\nTherefore, the function \\( f(g(x^3)) \\) is \\(\\boxed{even}\\).<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>"

Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you multiply two polynomials, the degree of the resulting polynomial is the sum of the degrees of the two polynomials being multiplied. Here, the left side is (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) multiplied by p(x), and the right side is a fourth-degree polynomial, which is x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25. So, if I let the degree of p(x) be n, then 2 + n = 4 because the left side will have degree 2 + n. Therefore, n must be 2, which means p(x) is a quadratic polynomial. So, p(x) must be of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are constants that I need to find.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation: (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5)(ax\u00b2 + bx + c) = x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25. My job is to expand the left side and then compare the coefficients with the right side to find a, b, and c.\n\nLet me expand the left side step by step. I'll distribute each term in (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) across each term in (ax\u00b2 + bx + c):\n\nFirst, multiply x\u00b2 by each term in (ax\u00b2 + bx + c):\n- x\u00b2 * ax\u00b2 = a x\u2074\n- x\u00b2 * bx = b x\u00b3\n- x\u00b2 * c = c x\u00b2\n\nNext, multiply -3x by each term in (ax\u00b2 + bx + c):\n- -3x * ax\u00b2 = -3a x\u00b3\n- -3x * bx = -3b x\u00b2\n- -3x * c = -3c x\n\nThen, multiply 5 by each term in (ax\u00b2 + bx + c):\n- 5 * ax\u00b2 = 5a x\u00b2\n- 5 * bx = 5b x\n- 5 * c = 5c\n\nSo, combining all these terms, the left side becomes:\na x\u2074 + b x\u00b3 + c x\u00b2 - 3a x\u00b3 - 3b x\u00b2 - 3c x + 5a x\u00b2 + 5b x + 5c\n\nNow, I need to combine the like terms:\n\nFor x\u2074: a x\u2074\n\nFor x\u00b3: b x\u00b3 - 3a x\u00b3 = (b - 3a) x\u00b3\n\nFor x\u00b2: c x\u00b2 - 3b x\u00b2 + 5a x\u00b2 = (c - 3b + 5a) x\u00b2\n\nFor x: -3c x + 5b x = ( -3c + 5b ) x\n\nConstant term: 5c\n\nSo, putting it all together, the expanded form is:\na x\u2074 + (b - 3a) x\u00b3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x\u00b2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c\n\nNow, this should be equal to the right side, x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25.\n\nTherefore, we can set up equations by comparing coefficients for each power of x.\n\nLet me write down these equations:\n\n1. Coefficient of x\u2074: a = 1\n2. Coefficient of x\u00b3: b - 3a = -3\n3. Coefficient of x\u00b2: c - 3b + 5a = 0 (since there's no x\u00b2 term on the right side)\n4. Coefficient of x: (-3c + 5b) = 15\n5. Constant term: 5c = -25\n\nOkay, now I can solve these equations step by step.\n\nStarting with equation 1: a = 1. That gives me a = 1.\n\nPlug a = 1 into equation 2: b - 3(1) = -3 => b - 3 = -3. Adding 3 to both sides gives b = 0.\n\nNow, with a = 1 and b = 0, let's move to equation 3: c - 3(0) + 5(1) = 0 => c + 5 = 0 => c = -5.\n\nNow, check equation 4 with b = 0 and c = -5: (-3*(-5) + 5*0) = 15 + 0 = 15, which matches the right side (15). So, equation 4 is satisfied.\n\nFinally, equation 5: 5c = -25. With c = -5, let's check this: 5*(-5) = -25, which is correct.\n\nSo, all equations have been satisfied with a = 1, b = 0, c = -5. Therefore, the polynomial p(x) is ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 1x\u00b2 + 0x - 5, which simplifies to x\u00b2 - 5.\n\nLet me quickly double-check my solution by multiplying (x\u00b2 - 3x +5) by (x\u00b2 -5) to make sure I get x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25.\n\nMultiplying:\n\nFirst, x\u00b2 times x\u00b2 = x\u2074\n\nx\u00b2 times (-5) = -5x\u00b2\n\n-3x times x\u00b2 = -3x\u00b3\n\n-3x times (-5) = 15x\n\n5 times x\u00b2 = 5x\u00b2\n\n5 times (-5) = -25\n\nSo, combining:\n\nx\u2074\n\n-3x\u00b3\n\n-5x\u00b2 + 5x\u00b2 = 0x\u00b2\n\n15x\n\n-25\n\nSo, putting altogether: x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25, which is x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Perfect, that's exactly the right side. So, p(x) = x\u00b2 -5.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. Let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Also, just to be sure, is there any other way this could be approached?\n\nAnother possible method is polynomial division: divide x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x -25 by x\u00b2 -3x +5 and see if I get p(x).\n\nLet me try that.\n\nDivide x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25 by x\u00b2 -3x +5.\n\nSetting it up:\n\nDividend: x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +0x\u00b2 +15x -25\n\nDivisor: x\u00b2 -3x +5\n\nWe divide term by term.\n\nFirst term: x\u2074 divided by x\u00b2 is x\u00b2.\n\nMultiply divisor by x\u00b2: x\u00b2*(x\u00b2 -3x +5)=x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2\n\nSubtract this from the dividend:\n\n(x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +0x\u00b2 +15x -25) - (x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2) = 0x\u2074 +0x\u00b3 -5x\u00b2 +15x -25\n\nSo, now we have: -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nNext, divide this by the divisor x\u00b2 -3x +5. The leading term is -5x\u00b2 divided by x\u00b2 is -5.\n\nMultiply divisor by -5: -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nSubtract this from the current dividend:\n\n(-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) - (-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) = 0\n\nSo, no remainder. Thus, the quotient is x\u00b2 -5, which is exactly what I found earlier.\n\nOkay, that's another way to verify it, and the result is the same. So, p(x) is definitely x\u00b2 -5.\n\nWait, just one more check. Let me try synthetic division or another method.\n\nBut dividing a quartic by a quadratic, long division is probably straightforward, which I just did, and it worked.\n\nAlternatively, I can also try plugging in some values.\n\nLet me suppose p(x) = x\u00b2 -5, then when x=1, (1 -3 +5)p(1) = (3)(1 -5)=3*(-4)=-12; On the right side, x=1: 1 -3 +15 -25= (1-3)=-2, (15-25)=-10, so total is (-12). So, yes, it matches.\n\nAnother test, x=0: Left side: p(0)*(0 - 0 +5)=?\n\nWait, No, for x=0, plugging in, left side is (0 -0 +5)*p(0)=5*p(0). Right side is 0 -0 +0 -25 = -25. So, 5*p(0) = -25, which implies p(0)= -5. Looking at p(x)=x\u00b2 -5, p(0)=0 -5= -5, which is correct. That's consistent.\n\nTest another value: x=2. Left side: (4 -6 +5)*p(2)= (3)* (4 -5)=3*(-1)=-3.\n\nRight side: 16 -24 +30 -25= (16-24)= -8, (30-25)=5. So, (-8+5)= -3. Which matches. So, yeah, p(2) is 4-5=-1, and 3*(-1)= -3. That's good.\n\nHmm. Alright, I think I've verified it enough.\n\nThe polynomial p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\(\\boxed{x^2 - 5}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25\\), we start by noting that the degree of \\( p(x) \\) must be 2 since the product on the left side is a fourth-degree polynomial.

In this case, one of them is a quadratic (\\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\)) and when multiplied by \\( p(x) \\), it results in a quartic polynomial (\\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\)). So, that means \\( p(x) \\) must be a quadratic polynomial itself, right? Because when a quadratic multiplies another quadratic, you get a quartic. Let me confirm that: yes, (degree 2) * (degree n) = degree (2 + n). Here, the result is degree 4, so \\( p(x) \\) must be degree 2. So, \\( p(x) \\) is a quadratic.\n\nSo, let me represent \\( p(x) \\) as \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants that I need to find. My goal is to find these constants such that when I multiply \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) by \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), I get the given quartic polynomial.\n\nAlright, let's set up the multiplication. I'll write the product:\n\n\\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c) \\)\n\nI need to expand this and then set it equal to \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). Then, by equating the coefficients of like terms, I can solve for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nFirst, let's carry out the multiplication step by step. Let's expand term by term.\n\nMultiply \\( x^2 \\) by each term in \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\):\n- \\( x^2 * ax^2 = a x^4 \\)\n- \\( x^2 * bx = b x^3 \\)\n- \\( x^2 * c = c x^2 \\)\n\nNext, multiply \\( -3x \\) by each term in \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\):\n- \\( -3x * ax^2 = -3a x^3 \\)\n- \\( -3x * bx = -3b x^2 \\)\n- \\( -3x * c = -3c x \\)\n\nThen, multiply \\( 5 \\) by each term in \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\):\n- \\( 5 * ax^2 = 5a x^2 \\)\n- \\( 5 * bx = 5b x \\)\n- \\( 5 * c = 5c \\)\n\nNow, let's write down all these terms together:\n\n1. \\( a x^4 \\)\n2. \\( b x^3 \\)\n3. \\( c x^2 \\)\n4. \\( -3a x^3 \\)\n5. \\( -3b x^2 \\)\n6. \\( -3c x \\)\n7. \\( 5a x^2 \\)\n8. \\( 5b x \\)\n9. \\( 5c \\)\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\nFirst, for \\( x^4 \\):\n- Only term 1: \\( a x^4 \\)\n\nNext, \\( x^3 \\):\n- Term 2: \\( b x^3 \\)\n- Term 4: \\( -3a x^3 \\)\nSo, combined: \\( (b - 3a) x^3 \\)\n\nNext, \\( x^2 \\):\n- Term 3: \\( c x^2 \\)\n- Term 5: \\( -3b x^2 \\)\n- Term 7: \\( 5a x^2 \\)\nCombined: \\( (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 \\)\n\nNext, \\( x \\):\n- Term 6: \\( -3c x \\)\n- Term 8: \\( 5b x \\)\nCombined: \\( (-3c + 5b) x \\)\n\nFinally, constant term:\n- Term 9: \\( 5c \\)\n\nSo putting it all together, the product is:\n\n\\( a x^4 + (b - 3a) x^3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c \\)\n\nAnd this product equals the given quartic: \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nNow, let's set the coefficients equal for each power of \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, since the product must equal the given polynomial, their corresponding coefficients must match.\n\nStarting with the highest degree, which is \\( x^4 \\):\n\n1. Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\) in the product: \\( a \\)\n   - Coefficient in the given polynomial: 1\n   - So, equation: \\( a = 1 \\)\n\nNext, \\( x^3 \\):\n2. Coefficient in product: \\( b - 3a \\)\n   - Coefficient in given poly.: -3\n   - Equation: \\( b - 3a = -3 \\)\n   Since \\( a = 1 \\), substitute:\n   \\( b - 3(1) = -3 \\)\n   \\( b - 3 = -3 \\)\n   Add 3 to both sides: \\( b = 0 \\)\n\nHmm, so \\( b = 0 \\). Interesting, so the linear term in \\( p(x) \\) is zero. That might have been expected or not; let me keep going.\n\nNext, coefficient of \\( x^2 \\):\n3. Coefficient in product: \\( c - 3b + 5a \\)\n   - Coefficient in given poly.: 0 (since there is no \\( x^2 \\) term, it's implicitly 0)\n   So, equation: \\( c - 3b + 5a = 0 \\)\n   Substitute \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\):\n   \\( c - 0 + 5(1) = 0 \\)\n   \\( c + 5 = 0 \\)\n   Therefore, \\( c = -5 \\)\n\nOkay, moving on to the coefficient of \\( x \\):\n\n4. Coefficient in product: \\( -3c + 5b \\)\n   - Coefficient in given poly.: 15\n   So, equation: \\( -3c + 5b = 15 \\)\n   Substitute \\( b = 0 \\) and \\( c = -5 \\):\n   \\( -3*(-5) + 5*0 = 15 \\)\n   \\( 15 + 0 = 15 \\)\n   That's good, 15=15, which is consistent.\n\nLastly, the constant term:\n\n5. Coefficient in product: \\( 5c \\)\n   - Coefficient in given poly.: -25\n   So, equation: \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n   Substitute \\( c = -5 \\):\n   \\( 5*(-5) = -25 \\)\n   \\( -25 = -25 \\)\n   Perfect, that works out.\n\nSo, in summary, we found:\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = 0 \\)\n- \\( c = -5 \\)\n\nTherefore, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is:\n\n\\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = 1x^2 + 0x + (-5) = x^2 - 5 \\)\n\nLet me just verify this to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's multiply \\( x^2 - 3x +5 \\) by \\( x^2 - 5 \\) and check if we get the given quartic.\n\nMultiplying them together:\n\nFirst, \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)(x^2 - 5) \\)\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\n1. \\( x^2 * x^2 = x^4 \\)\n2. \\( x^2 * (-5) = -5x^2 \\)\n3. \\( -3x * x^2 = -3x^3 \\)\n4. \\( -3x * (-5) = 15x \\)\n5. \\( 5 * x^2 = 5x^2 \\)\n6. \\( 5 * (-5) = -25 \\)\n\nCombine these terms:\n\n\\( x^4 - 5x^2 - 3x^3 + 15x + 5x^2 -25 \\)\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n- \\( x^4 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 \\)\n- \\( (-5x^2 + 5x^2) = 0x^2 \\)\n- \\( 15x \\)\n- \\( -25 \\)\n\nSo the result is:\n\n\\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x -25 \\)\n\nWhich is exactly the given polynomial. So yes, that checks out. Therefore, my solution is correct.\n\nSo, to recap, by representing \\( p(x) \\) as a quadratic and matching coefficients, I found that \\( p(x) \\) is \\( x^2 - 5 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that\n\\[ (x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25, \\]\nwe start by noting that \\( p(x) \\) must be a quadratic polynomial, as the given polynomial is of degree 4 and we are multiplying by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\). Let \\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\).\n\nExpanding the product \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c)\\), we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c) &= x^2(ax^2 + bx + c) - 3x(ax^2 + bx + c) + 5(ax^2 + bx + c) \\\\\n&= a x^4 + b x^3 + c x^2 - 3a x^3 - 3b x^2 - 3c x + 5a x^2 + 5b x + 5c.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms, we have:\n\\[\na x^4 + (b - 3a) x^3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c.\n\\]\n\nWe compare this with the given polynomial \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) and set up the following equations by matching coefficients:\n1. Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\): \\( a = 1 \\)\n2. Coefficient of \\( x^3 \\): \\( b - 3a = -3 \\)\n3. Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\): \\( c - 3b + 5a = 0 \\)\n4. Coefficient of \\( x \\): \\( -3c + 5b = 15 \\)\n5. Constant term: \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\nSolving these equations step-by-step:\n1. From \\( a = 1 \\), we get \\( a = 1 \\).\n2. Substituting \\( a = 1 \\) into \\( b - 3a = -3 \\), we get \\( b - 3 = -3 \\) which gives \\( b = 0 \\).\n3. Substituting \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\) into \\( c - 3b + 5a = 0 \\), we get \\( c + 5 = 0 \\) which gives \\( c = -5 \\).\n4. Substituting \\( b = 0 \\) and \\( c = -5 \\) into \\( -3c + 5b = 15 \\), we verify \\( 15 = 15 \\).\n5. Substituting \\( c = -5 \\) into \\( 5c = -25 \\), we verify \\( -25 = -25 \\).\n\nThus, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\( x^2 - 5 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x^2 - 5}\n\\]<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>",

Hmm, okay. So, essentially, I have the equation:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25\n\\]\n\nMy goal is to solve for \\( p(x) \\). I think a good way to approach this is by performing polynomial division, right? Because if I divide the right-hand side polynomial by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\), the result should be \\( p(x) \\). \n\nLet me recall how polynomial division works. It's kind of like long division with numbers, but involving polynomials. The steps are to divide the leading term of the dividend by the leading term of the divisor, multiply the entire divisor by that result, subtract from the dividend, and repeat the process with the new polynomial. \n\nSo first, let me write down the dividend and the divisor more clearly. The dividend is \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25 \\) because I notice that the original right-hand side didn't have an \\( x^2 \\) term, so I'll include a zero coefficient for that to make it easier. The divisor is \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\nLet me set up the long division:\n\nDividing \\( x^4 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) gives me \\( x^2 \\). So, I write \\( x^2 \\) above the division line. Then, I multiply \\( x^2 \\) by the divisor \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\), which gives me:\n\n\\( x^2 \\times x^2 = x^4 \\),\n\\( x^2 \\times (-3x) = -3x^3 \\),\n\\( x^2 \\times 5 = 5x^2 \\).\n\nSo, that gives \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).\n\nNext, I subtract this result from the original dividend:\n\n\\( (x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x -25) - (x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2) \\).\n\nLet me subtract term by term:\n\n- \\( x^4 - x^4 = 0 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 - (-3x^3) = 0 \\)\n- \\( 0x^2 - 5x^2 = -5x^2 \\)\n- \\( 15x - 0x = 15x \\)\n- \\( -25 - 0 = -25 \\)\n\nSo, the subtraction results in \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nNow, I bring down the remaining terms, but in this case, all terms have been accounted for, so the next dividend is \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nNow, I divide the leading term \\( -5x^2 \\) by the leading term of the divisor \\( x^2 \\), which is \\( -5 \\). So, I write \\( -5 \\) as the next term in the quotient.\n\nThen, I multiply \\( -5 \\) by the divisor \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\):\n\n\\( -5 \\times x^2 = -5x^2 \\),\n\\( -5 \\times (-3x) = 15x \\),\n\\( -5 \\times 5 = -25 \\).\n\nSo, that gives \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nAgain, I subtract this from the current polynomial:\n\n\\( (-5x^2 + 15x -25) - (-5x^2 + 15x -25) = 0 \\).\n\nSo, there's no remainder left, which is great. That means the division comes out perfectly, and the quotient is what I've found so far: \\( x^2 - 5 \\).\n\nWait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the beginning: I divided \\( x^4 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( x^2 \\), then multiplied \\( x^2 \\) by the divisor, got \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\), subtract that from \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25 \\), which gave me \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\). Then, I divided \\( -5x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( -5 \\), multiplied it by the divisor: \\( -5x^2 +15x -25 \\), and subtracted to get a remainder of 0. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the polynomial \\( p(x) = x^2 - 5 \\). Let me just verify by multiplying \\( x^2 - 3x +5 \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\) to see if I get the original polynomial.\n\nLet me perform this multiplication:\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( x^4 \\).\n\nThen \\( x^2 \\times -5 \\) gives \\( -5x^2 \\).\n\nNow, multiply \\( -3x \\) by \\( x^2 \\): \\( -3x^3 \\).\n\nThen, \\( -3x \\times -5 \\): \\( +15x \\).\n\nNext, \\( 5 \\times x^2 \\): \\( 5x^2 \\).\n\n\\( 5 \\times -5 \\): \\( -25 \\).\n\nSo now, writing all these terms together:\n\n\\( x^4 -5x^2 -3x^3 +15x +5x^2 -25 \\).\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\n\\( x^4 -3x^3 + (-5x^2 +5x^2) +15x -25 \\).\n\nSimplifies to:\n\n\\( x^4 -3x^3 + 0x^2 +15x -25 \\).\n\nWhich is exactly \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\), which is the given polynomial. \n\nSo, that confirms that when I multiply \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\), I indeed get the desired result.\n\nTherefore, I think my solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25,\n\\]\n\nwe perform polynomial long division of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n1. Divide the leading term \\( x^4 \\) by the leading term \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( x^2 \\).\n2. Multiply \\( x^2 \\) by the divisor \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) to get \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).\n3. Subtract this result from the original polynomial:\n   \\[\n   (x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25) - (x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2) = -5x^2 + 15x - 25.\n   \\]\n4. Divide the leading term \\( -5x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( -5 \\).\n5. Multiply \\( -5 \\) by the divisor \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) to get \\( -5x^2 + 15x - 25 \\).\n6. Subtract this result from the previous remainder:\n   \\[\n   (-5x^2 + 15x - 25) - (-5x^2 + 15x - 25) = 0.\n   \\]\n\nThe quotient from the division is \\( x^2 - 5 \\), and there is no remainder. Verifying by multiplication confirms the result.\n\nThus, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\(\\boxed{x^2 - 5}\\).<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>",

Let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that if I have two polynomials multiplied together and the result is another polynomial, the degrees of the polynomials should add up. Let me check, the degree of \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) is 2, and we're looking for \\( p(x) \\). The product is \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\), which is a degree 4 polynomial. So, since \\( 2 + \\text{degree of } p = 4 \\), the degree of \\( p(x) \\) must be \\( 2 \\). That makes sense.

That way, I can set up equations for each coefficient and solve for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nLet me multiply \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) by \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\):\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 \\) by each term in \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\):\n- \\( x^2 \\times ax^2 = a x^4 \\)\n- \\( x^2 \\times bx = b x^3 \\)\n- \\( x^2 \\times c = c x^2 \\)\n\nNext, multiply \\( -3x \\) by each term:\n- \\( -3x \\times ax^2 = -3a x^3 \\)\n- \\( -3x \\times bx = -3b x^2 \\)\n- \\( -3x \\times c = -3c x \\)\n\nThen, multiply \\( 5 \\) by each term:\n- \\( 5 \\times ax^2 = 5a x^2 \\)\n- \\( 5 \\times bx = 5b x \\)\n- \\( 5 \\times c = 5c \\)\n\nNow let's write all these terms out:\n\n1. \\( a x^4 \\)\n2. \\( b x^3 + (-3a) x^3 \\) [since \\( b x^3 - 3a x^3 \\)]\n3. \\( c x^2 + (-3b) x^2 + 5a x^2 \\) [since \\( c x^2 - 3b x^2 + 5a x^2 \\)]\n4. \\( (-3c x) + (5b x) = (5b - 3c) x \\)\n5.

Let \\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\).\n\nWe multiply \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) by \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) and equate the coefficients of the resulting polynomial to those of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nExpanding the product:\n\n1. \\( x^2 \\times ax^2 = a x^4 \\)\n2. \\( x^2 \\times bx = b x^3 \\)\n3. \\( x^2 \\times c = c x^2 \\)\n4. \\( -3x \\times ax^2 = -3a x^3 \\)\n5. \\( -3x \\times bx = -3b x^2 \\)\n6. \\( -3x \\times c = -3c x \\)\n7. \\( 5 \\times ax^2 = 5a x^2 \\)\n8. \\( 5 \\times bx = 5b x \\)\n9. \\( 5 \\times c = 5c \\)\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n- The \\( x^4 \\) term: \\( a \\)\n- The \\( x^3 \\) terms: \\( b - 3a \\)\n- The \\( x^2 \\) terms: \\( c - 3b + 5a \\)\n- The \\( x \\) term: \\( 5b - 3c \\)\n- The constant term: \\( 5c \\)\n\nEquating these to the coefficients of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\):\n\n1. \\( a = 1 \\)\n2. \\( b - 3a = -3 \\)\n3. \\( c - 3b + 5a = 0 \\)\n4. \\( 5b - 3c = 15 \\)\n5. \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\nSolving these equations:\n\n1.

Checking consistency, \\( c - 3b + 5a = 0 \\) gives \\( -5 - 0 + 5(1) = 0 \\), which is true.\n\nThus, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\( x^2 - 5 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x^2 - 5}\n\\]<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>",
        "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c><\uff5cUser\uff5c>Please solve the following mathematical problem, placing your final answer within \\boxed{}:\nFind the polynomial $p(x)$ if\n$$(x^2-3x+5)p(x) = x^4-3x^3+15x-25.$$<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where I need to find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that when I multiply it by \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) \\), I get \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). Hmm, okay. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if I have two polynomials multiplied together and I can express one as the product of the other and another polynomial, division is the key. Since \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) \\) is a quadratic polynomial, and we're multiplying it by another polynomial \\( p(x) \\) to get a quartic (degree 4) polynomial. That means \\( p(x) \\) must be a quadratic polynomial itself because when you multiply a quadratic by a quadratic, you get a quartic.\n\nLet me write that down. If \\( p(x) \\) is quadratic, then I can express it as \\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\). Then, multiplying \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) \\) by \\( (ax^2 + bx + c) \\) should equal the given quartic. So, my goal is to find the coefficients \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nLet me set that up. The multiplication would look like:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c)\n\\]\n\nI need to expand this product and then equate it to the given polynomial \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). After expanding, I can compare coefficients of corresponding powers of \\( x \\) to set up equations for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nAlright, let's carry out the multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll distribute \\( ax^2 \\) across each term in the first polynomial:\n\n- \\( x^2 \\cdot ax^2 = a x^{4} \\)\n- \\( (-3x) \\cdot ax^2 = -3a x^{3} \\)\n- \\( 5 \\cdot ax^2 = 5a x^{2} \\)\n\nNext, distribute \\( bx \\) across each term in the first polynomial:\n\n- \\( x^2 \\cdot bx = b x^{3} \\)\n- \\( (-3x) \\cdot bx = -3b x^{2} \\)\n- \\( 5 \\cdot bx = 5b x \\)\n\nThen, distribute \\( c \\) across each term in the first polynomial:\n\n- \\( x^2 \\cdot c = c x^{2} \\)\n- \\( (-3x) \\cdot c = -3c x \\)\n- \\( 5 \\cdot c = 5c \\)\n\nNow, let's write all these terms out:\n\n1. \\( a x^{4} \\)\n2. \\( -3a x^{3} \\)\n3. \\( 5a x^{2} \\)\n4. \\( b x^{3} \\)\n5. \\( -3b x^{2} \\)\n6. \\( 5b x \\)\n7. \\( c x^{2} \\)\n8. \\( -3c x \\)\n9. \\( 5c \\)\n\nNext, I need to combine like terms.\n\nLooking for \\( x^{4} \\) terms: only the first term, which is \\( a x^{4} \\). So that coefficient is \\( a \\).\n\nFor \\( x^{3} \\) terms: we have \\( -3a x^{3} \\) and \\( b x^{3} \\), so when combined, it's \\( (-3a + b) x^{3} \\).\n\nFor \\( x^{2} \\) terms: \\( 5a x^{2} \\), \\( -3b x^{2} \\), and \\( c x^{2} \\), so combined, that's \\( (5a - 3b + c) x^{2} \\).\n\nFor \\( x \\) terms: \\( 5b x \\) and \\( -3c x \\), so combined, that's \\( (5b - 3c) x \\).\n\nAnd the constant term is just \\( 5c \\).\n\nSo summarizing, the entire expansion is:\n\n\\[\na x^{4} + (-3a + b) x^{3} + (5a - 3b + c)x^{2} + (5b - 3c) x + 5c\n\\]\n\nNow, we have this equal to the given polynomial \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). Let me write down that equation:\n\n\\[\na x^{4} + (-3a + b) x^{3} + (5a - 3b + c)x^{2} + (5b - 3c) x + 5c = x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25\n\\]\n\nWait a second, technically, the right-hand side doesn't show \\( x^2 \\) term, but technically, it's there with a coefficient of 0. That might be an important point. So, to properly set up the equations, I should compare coefficients for each degree.\n\nTherefore, the coefficients of corresponding powers must be equal. So, let's set them aside:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\):\n   \\( a = 1 \\) (Because RHS has 1 coefficient for \\( x^4 \\))\n\n2. Coefficient of \\( x^3 \\):\n   \\( -3a + b = -3 \\)\n\n3. Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\):\n   \\( 5a - 3b + c = 0 \\)\n\n4. Coefficient of \\( x \\):\n   \\( 5b - 3c = 15 \\)\n\n5. Constant term:\n   \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\nNow, that gives me a system of equations:\n\n1. \\( a = 1 \\)\n\n2. \\( -3a + b = -3 \\)\n\n3. \\( 5a - 3b + c = 0 \\)\n\n4. \\( 5b - 3c = 15 \\)\n\n5. \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\nAlright, let's solve this step by step.\n\nStarting with equation 1: \\( a = 1 \\). That\u2019s straightforward.\n\nMoving to equation 5: \\( 5c = -25 \\). Dividing both sides by 5, we get \\( c = -5 \\). So that gives us the value of \\( c \\).\n\nNow, let's plug \\( c = -5 \\) into equation 4: \\( 5b - 3c = 15 \\). Substituting:\n\n\\( 5b - 3*(-5) = 15 \\)\n\nCalculates to:\n\n\\( 5b + 15 = 15 \\)\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides: \\( 5b = 0 \\), so \\( b = 0 \\).\n\nOkay, now we have \\( b = 0 \\) and \\( c = -5 \\). Let's plug \\( a = 1 \\) into equation 2 to get \\( b \\). Wait, \\( a = 1 \\) and equation 2 is \\( -3a + b = -3 \\):\n\nSo, substituting \\( a = 1 \\):\n\n\\( -3(1) + b = -3 \\)\n\\( -3 + b = -3 \\)\nAdding 3 to both sides: \\( b = 0 \\). Okay, that matches the result from equation 4. Good, no contradictions there.\n\nNow, let's check equation 3: \\( 5a - 3b + c = 0 \\)\n\nWe know \\( a=1 \\), \\( b=0 \\), and \\( c=-5 \\):\n\n\\( 5(1) - 3(0) + (-5) = 5 - 0 -5 = 0 \\). Exactly, so equation 3 is satisfied.\n\nThus, all equations are consistent, and we have our values:\n\n\\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), \\( c = -5 \\)\n\nSo, putting it all together, the quadratic polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is:\n\n\\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = 1x^2 + 0x -5 = x^2 -5 \\)\n\nWait, hold on a moment. Let me just verify that to make sure we don't have a mistake.\n\nLet me compute \\( (x^2 - 3x +5)(x^2 -5) \\) and see if it equals \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\): that's \\( x^4 -5x^2 \\)\n\nNext, multiply \\( -3x \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\): that's \\( -3x^3 +15x \\)\n\nThen, multiply \\(5 \\) by \\( x^2 -5 \\): that's \\( 5x^2 -25 \\)\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n\\( x^4 -5x^2 -3x^3 +15x +5x^2 -25 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- \\( x^4 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 \\)\n- \\( (-5x^2 +5x^2) = 0x^2 \\)\n- \\(15x \\)\n- \\( -25 \\)\n\nSo, the result is \\( x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25 \\). Which simplifies to \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\), which is exactly the polynomial we wanted. Perfect, so our solution is correct.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe we can perform polynomial long division as another method to see if \\( (x^2 - 3x +5) \\) divides into \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\) evenly, giving us \\( p(x) \\) as a quadratic.\n\nSo, if I perform \\( \\frac{x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25}{x^2 -3x +5} \\), the result should be \\( x^2 +0x -5 \\), which is \\( x^2 -5 \\).\n\nLet me set up the division:\n\nDivide \\( x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25 \\) by \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\).\n\n1. How many times does \\( x^2 \\) go into \\( x^4 \\)? It's \\( x^2 \\). Multiply \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\), which is \\( x^4 -3x^3 +5x^2 \\).\n\n2. Subtract this from the dividend:\n\n\\( (x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25) - (x^4 -3x^3 +5x^2) = 0x^4 +0x^3 -5x^2 +15x -25 \\)\n\n3. Now, bring down the next terms\u2014but here, all the coefficients are there, so move on.\n\n4. How many times does \\( x^2 \\) go into \\( -5x^2 \\)? It's \\(-5\\). Multiply \\( -5 \\) by \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\), which is \\( -5x^2 +15x -25 \\).\n\n5. Subtract this from the current dividend:\n\n\\( (-5x^2 +15x -25) - (-5x^2 +15x -25) = 0x^2 +0x +0 \\)\n\nSo, no remainder, which is perfect, and the quotient is \\( x^2 -5 \\), which again matches our previous result. So it's double-checked.\n\nAlternatively, if I am unsure, maybe I can try plugging in some values to see if both sides are equal.\n\nFor instance, let\u2019s pick x = 1.\n\nCompute LHS: \\( (1^2 -3*1 +5)(1^2 -5) = (1 -3 +5)(1 -5) = (3)(-4) = -12 \\)\n\nCompute RHS: \\(1^4 -3*1^3 +15*1 -25 =1 -3 +15 -25= (1 -3) + (15 -25) = (-2) + (-10)= -12 \\). So that works.\n\nLet me try another value, say x=2.\n\nCompute LHS: \\( (4 -6 +5)(4 -5)= (3)(-1)= -3 \\)\n\nCompute RHS: 16 -24 +30 -25= (16-24) + (30-25)= (-8)+(5)= -3. That works too.\n\nHow about x=0? Let me see.\n\nLHS: \\( (0 -0 +5)(0 -5)=5*(-5)= -25 \\)\n\nRHS: 0 +0 +0 -25= -25. That matches as well.\n\nAnother test at x= -1.\n\nLHS: (1 +3 +5)(1 -5)=9*(-4)= -36\n\nRHS: 1 +3 + (-15) -25=1 +3 -15 -25= 4 -40= -36. Perfect.\n\nSo, all tests are passing, confirming that our polynomial \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\nIs there another way to approach",

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I know that \\( p(x) \\) must be a polynomial because both \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) \\) and the result are polynomials. So, if I have a polynomial multiplied by a quadratic to get a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, that means \\( p(x) \\) must be a quadratic as well. Because if you multiply a quadratic by a quadratic, the highest degree term is 4. So, that suggests \\( p(x) \\) is a quadratic polynomial. \n\nLet me write that down. So, let me denote \\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants that I need to find. Got that.\n\nNow, the equation is \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). My task is to expand the left-hand side and then equate the coefficients with the right-hand side to find \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nSo, I'm going to proceed to expand \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c) \\).\n\nLet me recall that polynomial multiplication is done term by term. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and then like terms are combined.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n1. Multiply \\( x^2 \\) from the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\( x^2 \\cdot ax^2 = a x^{2+2} = a x^4 \\)\n   - \\( x^2 \\cdot bx = b x^{2+1} = b x^3 \\)\n   - \\( x^2 \\cdot c = c x^2 \\)\n\n2. Multiply \\( -3x \\) from the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\( -3x \\cdot ax^2 = -3a x^{1+2} = -3a x^3 \\)\n   - \\( -3x \\cdot bx = -3b x^{1+1} = -3b x^2 \\)\n   - \\( -3x \\cdot c = -3c x \\)\n\n3. Multiply \\( 5 \\) from the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:\n   - \\( 5 \\cdot ax^2 = 5a x^2 \\)\n   - \\( 5 \\cdot bx = 5b x \\)\n   - \\( 5 \\cdot c = 5c \\)\n\nNow, let me add up all these terms:\n\n- The \\( x^4 \\) term: \\( a x^4 \\)\n- The \\( x^3 \\) terms: \\( b x^3 - 3a x^3 \\) which combines to \\( (b - 3a) x^3 \\)\n- The \\( x^2 \\) terms: \\( c x^2 - 3b x^2 + 5a x^2 \\) which combines to \\( (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 \\)\n- The \\( x \\) terms: \\( -3c x + 5b x \\) which combines to \\( (-3c + 5b) x \\)\n- The constant term is \\( 5c \\ )\n\nSo, putting it all together, the expanded left-hand side becomes:\n\\( a x^4 + (b - 3a) x^3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c \\)\n\nNow, this must equal the right-hand side, which is \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\). \n\nSo, let's write out the equation:\n\n\\[\na x^4 + (b - 3a) x^3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c = x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25\n\\]\n\nWait, hold on. When writing polynomials, the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) in the right-hand side is zero because there's no \\( x^2 \\) term. So I added \\( 0x^2 \\) to represent that. Similarly, the constants are 15 for \\( x \\) and -25 as the constant term.\n\nNow, since two polynomials are equal if and only if their corresponding coefficients of like terms are equal. So, let's set up equations for each coefficient:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\):\n   \\( a = 1 \\)\n\n2. Coefficient of \\( x^3 \\):\n   \\( b - 3a = -3 \\)\n\n3.

Okay, that's consistent.\n\nFinally, equation 5:\n\\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\\( c = -5 \\)\nWhich is the same result as above.\n\nSo, all equations are consistent, and we've got \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), \\( c = -5 \\).\n\nTherefore, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is:\n\n\\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = 1x^2 + 0x -5 = x^2 -5 \\)\n\nWait a minute, so \\( p(x) \\) is \\( x^2 - 5 \\)? Let me verify that.\n\nLet me multiply \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) \\) by \\( (x^2 -5) \\):\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 \\cdot x^2 = x^4 \\)\n\n\\( x^2 \\cdot (-5) = -5x^2 \\)\n\nThen, \\( -3x \\cdot x^2 = -3x^3 \\)\n\n\\( -3x \\cdot (-5) = 15x \\)\n\nThen, \\( 5 \\cdot x^2 = 5x^2 \\)\n\n\\( 5 \\cdot (-5) = -25 \\)\n\nNow, let me add all these together:\n\n- \\( x^4 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 \\)\n- \\( -5x^2 + 5x^2 = 0x^2 \\)\n- \\( 15x \\)\n- \\( -25 \\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x -25 \\), which is exactly the given polynomial.\n\nSo, indeed, \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\) is the correct polynomial.\n\nBut, just to double-check, maybe do the multiplication in a different way, maybe vertically.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n      x^2 - 3x + 5\n    *    x^2 - 5\n    ---------------\nMultiply each term:\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 -5 \\) by 5: 5*(x^2 -5) = 5x^2 -25\n\nThen, multiply \\( x^2 -5 \\) by (-3x): -3x*(x^2 -5) = -3x^3 +15x\n\nThen, multiply \\( x^2 -5 \\) by x^2: x^2*(x^2 -5) = x^4 -5x^2\n\nNow, add them all up:\n\nFirst term: x^4 -5x^2\nSecond term: -3x^3 +15x\nThird term: 5x^2 -25\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx^4: 1x^4\nx^3: -3x^3\nx^2: -5x^2 +5x^2 = 0\nx terms: 15x\nconstants: -25\n\nSo altogether:\nx^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 which matches.\n\nSo yeah, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use polynomial division? Let me think.\n\nIf I have \\( (x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25) \\) divided by \\( (x^2 -3x +5) \\), I should get \\( p(x) \\). Maybe checking through polynomial division.\n\nSo, dividing \\( x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25 \\) by \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\).

Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if I have two polynomials multiplied together resulting in another polynomial, I can use polynomial division to find one polynomial if I know the other. In this case, I have the divisor (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) and the dividend is the result, which is x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25. So, I guess I need to divide x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25 by (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) to get p(x).\n\nLet me write this out: p(x) = (x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25) divided by (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5). Dividing polynomials usually involves polynomial long division. I've heard of this before; it's similar to dividing numbers, but with polynomials. I need to make sure I line up the terms properly.\n\nFirst, let me write both polynomials with their degrees in order. The dividend is a quartic (degree 4), and the divisor is a quadratic (degree 2). So, in long division, the divisor goes into the dividend.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2003_______________\nx\u00b2 - 3x + 5 ) x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25\n\nWait, I notice that in the dividend, there's no x\u00b2 term. So I should insert a placeholder with coefficient zero to make it easier. So, the dividend becomes x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nNow, I'll start the division.\n\nFirst term: x\u2074 divided by x\u00b2 is x\u00b2. So, the first term of the quotient is x\u00b2.\n\nMultiply the entire divisor by x\u00b2: x\u00b2*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2.\n\nSubtract this from the dividend:\n\n(x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 +15x -25) - (x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2) =\n\nx\u2074 - x\u2074 = 0\n\n-3x\u00b3 - (-3x\u00b3) = 0\n\n0x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 = -5x\u00b2\n\n15x remains.\n\n-25 remains.\n\nSo now, the new polynomial is -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nBring down the terms, but since we've subtracted completely, the next step is to divide this new polynomial by the divisor.\n\nNext term: -5x\u00b2 divided by x\u00b2 is -5.\n\nMultiply the divisor by -5: -5*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nSubtract this from the current polynomial:\n\n(-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) - (-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) = 0\n\nSo, there's no remainder.\n\nSo, adding the two terms, x\u00b2 and -5, gives the quotient as x\u00b2 -5.\n\nTherefore, p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\nLet me check if that's correct. Multiply p(x) by (x\u00b2 -3x +5) and see if we get x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25.\n\nWell, (x\u00b2 -5)(x\u00b2 -3x +5).\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nx\u00b2*(x\u00b2) = x\u2074\n\nx\u00b2*(-3x) = -3x\u00b3\n\nx\u00b2*5 =5x\u00b2\n\n-5*(x\u00b2) = -5x\u00b2\n\n-5*(-3x)=15x\n\n-5*5 = -25\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx\u2074\n\n-3x\u00b3\n\n5x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 =0x\u00b2\n\n15x\n\n-25\n\nSo, we get x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 +0x\u00b2 +15x -25, which is equal to the given dividend x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +0x\u00b2 +15x -25. That checks out. So p(x) is indeed x\u00b2 -5. Cool.\n\nWait, let me recap the division steps because I want to make sure I didn't make any mistake there.\n\n1. Checked if I have all the missing terms with zero coefficients, which I did.\n\n2. First term: x\u2074 divided by x\u00b2 is x\u00b2. Multiply divisor by x\u00b2 gives x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2.\n\n3. Subtracted that, got 0 for x\u2074 and x\u00b3, -5x\u00b2 remains because 0x\u00b2 was there and 5x\u00b2 was subtracted.\n\n4. Then, next term is -5x\u00b2 /x\u00b2 is -5. Multiply divisor by -5, which is -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\n5. Subtract that from the current -5x\u00b2 +15x -25, and everything cancels out, remainder zero.\n\nSo, quotient is x\u00b2 -5. Therefore, p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\nI was a bit nervous when subtracting the polynomials, but breaking it down step by step seems to hold. Let me just visualize the multiplication again:\n\n(x\u00b2 -5)(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = x\u00b2*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) -5*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 +15x -25. As you can see, 5x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 cancels, and then you're left with x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25, which is exactly the given polynomial.\n\nSo, yeah, I think I'm confident that p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25\\), we perform polynomial long division of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n1. **Set up the division**: Divide \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n2. **First term**: \\( x^4 \\) divided by \\( x^2 \\) gives \\( x^2 \\).\n3. **Multiply and subtract**: Multiply \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) to get \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).

Hmm, interesting. I'm going to need to figure out what p(x) is. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that if I have two polynomials multiplied together and that their product is given, I can find the unknown polynomial by division. So p(x) must be the result when I divide x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25 by x\u00b2 - 3x + 5. That makes sense because polynomial division is like the opposite of multiplication. So I can set this up as a long division problem.\n\nAlright, let me write down the division. The dividend is x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 + 15x - 25, wait, why 0x\u00b2? Oh, because in the original polynomial x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 15x - 25, the x\u00b2 term is missing. So I need to include a zero coefficient for that term to make the division accurate. Otherwise, I might misalign terms later on.\n\nSo, the divisor is x\u00b2 - 3x + 5. Let's set up the long division: \n\nWe start by dividing the first term of the dividend, which is x\u2074, by the first term of the divisor, which is x\u00b2. That gives x\u00b2. So, the first term of the quotient is x\u00b2. Now, multiply the entire divisor by x\u00b2 to get x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 5x\u00b2. \n\nSubtracting this from the dividend, we have:\n\n(x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 + 15x - 25) minus (x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 + 5x\u00b2) equals 0x\u2074 + 0x\u00b3 -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nSo now, the new polynomial to work with is -5x\u00b2 +15x -25. Now, we take the first term of this, which is -5x\u00b2, and divide it by the first term of the divisor, which is x\u00b2. That gives us -5. So, the next term in the quotient is -5.\n\nMultiply the divisor by -5: -5x\u00b2 +15x -25. Subtract that from our current polynomial:\n\n(-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) minus (-5x\u00b2 +15x -25) equals 0x\u00b2 +0x +0.\n\nOh, wow, that subtracted perfectly with no remainder. So putting it all together, the quotient is x\u00b2 -5, and the remainder is zero, which is exactly what we needed. So p(x) must be x\u00b2 -5.\n\nBut wait, hold on a second. Let me just verify that I did everything correctly because sometimes math can be tricky. So, we constructed p(x) as x\u00b2 -5 and multiplied it by (x\u00b2 -3x +5) to see if we get the original polynomial.\n\nLet me do that multiplication step by step:\n\n(x\u00b2 -5)(x\u00b2 -3x +5). Let's distribute each term:\n\nFirst, x\u00b2*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2.\n\nThen, -5*(x\u00b2 -3x +5) = -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nNow, add those two results together:\n\nx\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 +15x -25.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-5x\u00b2 +5x\u00b2 cancels out, so 0x\u00b2. Then, we have x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Which is exactly the right-hand side of the equation given. That checks out.\n\nSo yes, p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25\\), we need to perform polynomial division of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n1. **Set up the division**: The dividend is \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25 \\) (including a placeholder for the missing \\( x^2 \\) term) and the divisor is \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n2. **First term of the quotient**: Divide the first term of the dividend \\( x^4 \\) by the first term of the divisor \\( x^2 \\), giving \\( x^2 \\).\n\n3. **Multiply and subtract**: Multiply the entire divisor by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).

It's similar to long division with numbers. So, I can start by writing it out step by step. First, I need to divide \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x -25 \\) (since there's no \\( x^2 \\) term) by \\( x^2 - 3x +5 \\).\n\nLet me set it up:\n\nDividend: \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x -25 \\)\nDivisor: \\( x^2 - 3x +5 \\)\n\nI start by dividing the leading term of the dividend \\( x^4 \\) by the leading term of the divisor \\( x^2 \\).

I divide the leading term \\( -5x^2 \\) by the leading term of the divisor \\( x^2 \\), which gives me \\( -5 \\). So, the next term in the quotient is \\( -5 \\).\n\nMultiply the divisor \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\) by \\( -5 \\):\n\\( -5 \\times (x^2 -3x +5) = -5x^2 +15x -25 \\).\n\nSubtracting this from the current polynomial:\n\\( (-5x^2 +15x -25 ) - (-5x^2 +15x -25) \\).\n\nCalculating term by term:\n- \\( -5x^2 - (-5x^2) = 0 \\)\n- \\( 15x - 15x = 0 \\)\n- \\( -25 - (-25) = 0 \\)\n\nSo, the remainder is zero. That means we're done.\n\nAdding up the terms we obtained in the quotient: \\( x^2 -5 \\). So, \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\).\n\nWait a second, let me check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

In this case, \\( p(x) \\) should be equal to \\( \\frac{x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25}{x^2 - 3x + 5} \\). That makes sense because division undoes multiplication.\n\nSo, maybe I can perform polynomial long division here. Let me set it up. I need to divide \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\). Let me write down the dividend and the divisor.\n\nDividing \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\). I notice that for clarity, I added a placeholder term \\( 0x^2 \\) for the missing \\( x^2 \\) term in the dividend. That way, I can systematically perform the division.\n\nOkay, starting with the first term of the dividend, \\( x^4 \\), and dividing it by the first term of the divisor, \\( x^2 \\). That gives me \\( x^2 \\). So, \\( x^2 \\) is the first term of the quotient \\( p(x) \\).\n\nNow, I multiply the entire divisor \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) which gives \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).\n\nNext, I subtract this result from the original dividend:\n\n\\( (x^4 - 3x^3 + 0x^2 + 15x - 25) - (x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2) \\)\n\nSubtracting term by term:\n\n- \\( x^4 - x^4 = 0 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 - (-3x^3) = 0 \\)\n- \\( 0x^2 - 5x^2 = -5x^2 \\)\n- \\( 15x - 0 = 15x \\)\n- \\( -25 - 0 = -25 \\)\n\nSo, the new polynomial after subtraction is \\( -5x^2 + 15x -25 \\).\n\nNow, I repeat the process with this new polynomial. Divide the first term \\( -5x^2 \\) by the first term of the divisor \\( x^2 \\), which gives me \\( -5 \\). So, the next term of the quotient is \\( -5 \\).\n\nNow, multiply the entire divisor by \\( -5 \\):\n\n\\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) * (-5) = -5x^2 + 15x -25 \\).\n\nSubtracting this from the previous remainder:\n\n\\( (-5x^2 +15x -25 ) - (-5x^2 +15x -25 ) \\)\n\nSubtracting term by term:\n\n- \\( -5x^2 - (-5x^2) = 0 \\)\n- \\( 15x -15x = 0 \\)\n- \\( -25 - (-25) =0 \\)\n\nSo, the remainder is 0.\n\nTherefore, the division is exact, and the quotient is the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) which we found through division. The quotient started as \\( x^2 \\) and then became \\( x^2 -5 \\) after the next term.\n\nSo, putting it all together, \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\).\n\nWait, let me verify this. If I multiply \\( (x^2 -3x +5) \\) by \\( (x^2 -5) \\), do I get \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\)?\n\nMultiplying \\( x^2 * x^2 = x^4 \\).\nThen, \\( x^2 * (-5) = -5x^2 \\).\nNext, \\( -3x * x^2 = -3x^3 \\).\nThen, \\( -3x * (-5) = 15x \\).\nNow, \\(5* x^2 =5x^2\\).\nThen,5* (-5) = -25.\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n- \\( x^4 \\)\n- \\( -3x^3 \\)\n- \\( -5x^2 +5x^2 = 0x^2 \\)\n- \\( +15x \\)\n- \\( -25 \\)\n\nSo, the product is \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\), which is exactly what was given. Therefore, the division was correct, and p(x) is indeed \\( x^2 -5 \\).\n\nAnother way I thought about this problem is by factoring. I know that if we have \\( (x^2 -3x +5)p(x) = x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\), maybe we can factor the right-hand side. Sometimes factoring can reveal the structure needed.\n\nLet me try to factor \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 \\). Hmm, factoring quartic polynomials can be tricky, but maybe it's a product of quadratics or something. Alternatively, perhaps it can be factored as the product of \\( x^2 -3x +5 \\) and another quadratic. Let me check.\n\nLet\u2019s assume \\( x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 = (x^2 -3x +5)(px^2 + qx + r) \\). If I can find p, q, r such that this holds, then that will help me get p(x). Alternatively, p is the quadratic we just found, but to see whether this works.\n\nMultiplying out the right-hand side:\n\n\\( (x^2 -3x +5)(px^2 + qx + r) \\)\n= \\( x^2(px^2 + qx + r) -3x(px^2 + qx + r) + 5(px^2 + qx + r) \\)\n= \\( px^4 + qx^3 + rx^2 -3px^3 -3qx^2 -3rx +5px^2 +5qx +5r \\)\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\n- \\( x^4: p \\)\n- \\( x^3: q -3p \\)\n- \\( x^2: r -3q +5p \\)\n- \\( x: -3r +5q \\)\n- Constant term: 5r\n\nNow, the left-hand side is \\( x^4 -3x^3 +0x^2 +15x -25 \\). So, setting up equations by equating coefficients:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\): p =1\n2. Coefficient of \\( x^3 \\): q -3p = -3\n3. Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\): r -3q +5p =0\n4. Coefficient of \\( x \\): -3r +5q =15\n5. Constant term: 5r = -25\n\nSo, let's solve these equations:\n\nFrom equation 1: p =1\n\nFrom equation 2: q -3(1) = -3 \u2192 q -3 = -3 \u2192 q=0\n\nFrom equation 5: 5r = -25 \u2192 r = -5\n\nNow, from equation 3: r -3q +5p = (-5) -0 +5(1) =0? Let's test:\n\nr -3q +5p = -5 -0 +5 =0, which is correct.\n\nAnd from equation 4: -3r +5q = -3(-5) + 0 =15, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, p=1, q=0, r=-5.\n\nTherefore, the quadratic factor is \\( x^2 +0x -5 =x^2 -5 \\). So, indeed, \\( p(x)=x^2 -5 \\). Therefore, factoring confirms the division result.\n\nAnother method I could consider is using synthetic division or other factoring techniques, but since both polynomial division and factoring lead me to the same result, I\u2019m confident that \\( p(x) =x^2 -5 \\).\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can graph both polynomials and see if their product makes sense, but graphing often isn't necessary if all the algebraic methods confirm the solution.\n\nAlternatively, I can plug in a value for x into both sides and verify.\n\nLet\u2019s pick x=1:\n\nCompute LHS: (1^2 -3*1 +5)*p(1) = (1 -3 +5)*p(1)=3*p(1)\nCompute RHS:1^4 -3*1^3 +15*1 -25 =1 -3 +15 -25= (1-3)= -2, (-2 +15)=13, (13-25)=-12. So RHS value at x=1 is -12.\nThus, 3*p(1)=-12, so p(1)= -4.\n\nNow, p(x)=x^2 -5, so p(1)=1 -5= -4. It matches.\n\nAnother test with x=2:\n\nLHS: (4 -6 +5)*p(2)= (3)*p(2)\nRHS:16 -24 +30 -25= (16-24)= -8, (-8+30)=22, (22-25)= -3. So RHS at x=2 is -3.\nTherefore, 3*p(2)= -3, so p(2)= -1.\n\nCompute p(2)= 4 -5= -1. That checks out.\n\nOne more test with x=0:\n\nLHS: (0 -0 +5)*p(0)=5*p(0)\nRHS:0 -0 +0 -25= -25. So, 5*p(0)= -25, p(0)= -5.\n\nCompute p(0)=0 -5= -5. That also works.\n\nSo, all my test points are satisfied, which adds more confidence that p(x)=x^2 -5 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way is to notice that the given polynomial x^4 -3x^3 +15x -25 might be factorable into two quadratics, one of which is x^2 -3x +5, so if I can factor it, that gives me p(x).\n\nBut perhaps an even quicker check is to plug in x= something that makes p(x) zero or something, but maybe not necessary here since the previous thoroughness is sufficient.\n\nThinking through, am I making any incorrect assumptions? The original setup is a product of polynomials and getting the quotient by division, but since both polynomials have integer coefficients, it's likely to be with lesser chance of error. Moreover, synthetic division would be faster if I thought in terms of factoring in (x - a), but in this case, since it's a quadratic, it's a bit more involved.\n\nBut as I already confirmed with factoring by coefficient comparison, it's sufficient. So, I think I'm confident that p(x)=x\u00b2 -5 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, just one thing\u2014when I first thought of polynomial division, I said the process, but then I thought of factoring, so maybe someone might get confused whether the factoring is necessary or not.\n\nBut in this case, since the question is phrased as multiplying p(x) and (x\u00b2 -3x +5), so actually, it's possible to state that p(x) is equal to the division. Thus, either method works.\n\nBut perhaps factoring can be a method in cases when known factors are present. For example, if both the dividend and divisor had some common factor, but in this case, I don't think that's applicable.\n\nAnother thought: maybe sometimes polynomials can have multiple factors or roots, but in this case, since the divisor is quadratic, and having found the other quadratic factor, that's sufficient. And it's another good check that after multiplying the two quadratics, one of them being known, I get back the dividend.\n\nThus, all in all, I think I\u2019ve approached the problem in multiple ways, and all confirm that \\( p(x) = x^2 -5 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\), we need to perform polynomial division of \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\).\n\n1. Divide \\( x^4 \\) by \\( x^2 \\) to get \\( x^2 \\).\n2. Multiply \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x^2 - 3x + 5 \\) to get \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 \\).\n3.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that \\( (x^2 - 3x + 5) \\) is a quadratic polynomial, and the product is a quartic polynomial (since the highest degree is 4). That makes sense because multiplying a quadratic by another quadratic would give a quartic. But in this case, \\( p(x) \\) must be a quadratic polynomial as well because \\( (x^2)(x^2) = x^4 \\).

Hmm, okay. Let's see. I guess p(x) must be a polynomial as well, right? Because if I multiply (x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) by p(x) and get a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, then p(x) has to be a quadratic (degree 2), since 2 (from x\u00b2 - 3x + 5) plus 2 (from p(x)) equals 4. That makes sense.\n\nSo, let me write p(x) as a general quadratic: p(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c. That seems like a good start because it covers all possibilities for a second-degree polynomial.\n\nNow, the equation given is (x\u00b2 - 3x +5)(ax\u00b2 + bx + c) = x\u2074 - 3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Okay, so if I multiply these two polynomials together, I should end up with that result. Therefore, I can expand the left-hand side and then set the coefficients equal to those on the right-hand side. Since the coefficients of corresponding powers of x must be equal for the two polynomials to be equal, I can set up equations and solve for a, b, and c.\n\nLet me go ahead and perform that multiplication. I'll multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.\n\nFirst, take x\u00b2 multiplied by each term in p(x):\n\n- x\u00b2 * ax\u00b2 = a x\u2074\n- x\u00b2 * bx = b x\u00b3\n- x\u00b2 * c = c x\u00b2\n\nThen, take -3x multiplied by each term in p(x):\n\n- -3x * ax\u00b2 = -3a x\u00b3\n- -3x * bx = -3b x\u00b2\n- -3x * c = -3c x\n\nNext, take +5 multiplied by each term in p(x):\n\n- 5 * ax\u00b2 = 5a x\u00b2\n- 5 * bx = 5b x\n- 5 * c = 5c\n\nNow, let's combine all those terms:\n\n= a x\u2074\n+ b x\u00b3 + c x\u00b2\n-3a x\u00b3 -3b x\u00b2 -3c x\n+5a x\u00b2 +5b x +5c\n\nNow, let's collect like terms:\n\n- x\u2074 term: a x\u2074\n- x\u00b3 terms: b x\u00b3 - 3a x\u00b3\n- x\u00b2 terms: c x\u00b2 -3b x\u00b2 +5a x\u00b2\n- x terms: -3c x +5b x\n- constant term: 5c\n\nSo, writing it all together:\n\n= a x\u2074 + (b - 3a) x\u00b3 + (c -3b +5a) x\u00b2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c\n\nNow, we know this is equal to x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. So, to find coefficients, let's set the coefficients equal for each power of x:\n\nFor x\u2074: a = 1\n\nFor x\u00b3: (b - 3a) = -3\n\nFor x\u00b2: (c - 3b +5a) = 0 (since there's no x\u00b2 term on the right side)\n\nFor x: (-3c +5b) = 15\n\nFor constant term: 5c = -25\n\nOkay, so that gives us a system of equations:\n\n1. a = 1\n\n2. b - 3a = -3\n\n3. c - 3b +5a = 0\n\n4. -3c +5b = 15\n\n5. 5c = -25\n\nAlright, let's solve these equations step by step starting from the first equation.\n\nEquation 1: a = 1. So, a is 1. That's straightforward.\n\nMoving to Equation 5: 5c = -25; so, divide both sides by 5, c = -25 / 5 = -5. So, c = -5.\n\nNow that we have a=1 and c=-5, let's plug into Equation 2: Equation 2 says b -3a = -3.\n\nSubstituting a=1, we get: b -3(1) = -3 => b -3 = -3 => b = 0\n\nWait, b = 0?\n\nLet me pause. Let me write down all these steps when plugging in:\n\nEquation 2: b -3a = -3\n\nWith a=1: b - 3(1) = -3 => b -3 = -3 => b = -3 +3 => b=0. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo, b=0. Okay, moving to Equation 3: c -3b +5a = 0.\n\nWe know c=-5, b=0, a=1, so:\n\n-5 -3(0) +5(1) = 0 => -5 +0 +5 = 0 => 0=0. Perfect, it holds.\n\nNow, let's move to Equation 4: -3c +5b = 15.\n\nPlug in c=-5, b=0:\n\n-3(-5)+5(0)=15 =>15 +0=15=>15=15. Also holds.\n\nHmm, so all the equations are consistent. So, we have a=1, b=0, c=-5.\n\nTherefore, the quadratic polynomial p(x)= ax\u00b2 +bx +c=1 x\u00b2 +0x -5 => x\u00b2 - 5.\n\nWait a second. Is that it? So, p(x)=x\u00b2 -5? Hmm. Let me verify.\n\nLet me multiply (x\u00b2 -3x +5) by (x\u00b2 -5) and see if I get the given quartic.\n\nSo, let's do that.\n\n(x\u00b2 -3x +5)(x\u00b2 -5). Let's compute term by term.\n\nFirst, x\u00b2 * x\u00b2 =x\u2074\n\nx\u00b2 * (-5)= -5x\u00b2\n\nThen, -3x *x\u00b2= -3x\u00b3\n\n-3x*(-5)=15x\n\nThen, +5* x\u00b2=5x\u00b2\n\n+5*(-5)= -25\n\nSo, combining all those:\n\nx\u2074 -5x\u00b2 -3x\u00b3 +15x +5x\u00b2 -25\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\nx\u2074 (only term)\n\n-3x\u00b3 (only term)\n\nThen, (-5x\u00b2 +5x\u00b2)=0x\u00b2\n\n15x (only term)\n\n-25 (constant term)\n\nSo, total polynomial is x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Which is exactly the given polynomial on the right-hand side.\n\nWow, that's perfect. So, my values of a=1, b=0, c=-5 result in p(x) = x\u00b2 -5, and this works.\n\nSo, therefore, p(x) is x\u00b2 -5.\n\nWait, maybe I should write p(x)=x\u00b2 -5 to make sure it's correct.\n\nBut let me just double-check my multiplication:\n\n(x\u00b2 -3x +5)(x\u00b2 -5) = x\u2074 -5x\u00b2 -3x\u00b3 +15x +5x\u00b2 -25. The x\u00b2 terms cancel out, and the rest gives x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Yes, that's exactly what we needed. So, seems correct.\n\nSo, like I thought, when we had a=1, b=0, c=-5, everything worked out. So, yeah, p(x) is definitely x\u00b2 -5. I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, maybe I can notice if the polynomials could have been factored or had some factors canceled, but (x\u00b2 -3x +5) is not factorable over the reals, as discriminant is 9 -20 = -11 <0, so it can't be factored into real linear terms.\n\nAlso, the right-hand side, x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +15x -25. Let me see, does that factor? Maybe if we can factor it into (x\u00b2 -3x +5) multiplied by something else, which we just did, but I think it's more work than I need.\n\nGiven that when I multiplied (x\u00b2 -3x +5)*(x\u00b2 -5) I got the exact polynomial on the right, then p(x) must be x\u00b2 -5.\n\nI think that\u2019s solid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is p(x) = x\u00b2 -5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) such that \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)p(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25\\), we assume \\( p(x) \\) is a quadratic polynomial of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\).\n\nExpanding \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)(ax^2 + bx + c)\\) and combining like terms, we get:\n\\[\na x^4 + (b - 3a) x^3 + (c - 3b + 5a) x^2 + (-3c + 5b) x + 5c\n\\]\n\nWe compare this with the given polynomial \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\) and set up the following system of equations by equating the coefficients of corresponding powers of \\( x \\):\n1. \\( a = 1 \\)\n2. \\( b - 3a = -3 \\)\n3. \\( c - 3b + 5a = 0 \\)\n4. \\( -3c + 5b = 15 \\)\n5. \\( 5c = -25 \\)\n\nSolving these equations step by step:\n1. From \\( a = 1 \\), we have \\( a = 1 \\).\n2. From \\( 5c = -25 \\), we get \\( c = -5 \\).\n3. Substituting \\( a = 1 \\) into \\( b - 3a = -3 \\), we get \\( b = 0 \\).\n4. Verifying with equations 3 and 4, we find that they hold true with \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), and \\( c = -5 \\).\n\nThus, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is:\n\\[\np(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = x^2 - 5\n\\]\n\nTo verify, we multiply \\((x^2 - 3x + 5)(x^2 - 5)\\) and confirm it results in \\( x^4 - 3x^3 + 15x - 25 \\).\n\nTherefore, the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\boxed{x^2 - 5}.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>"
